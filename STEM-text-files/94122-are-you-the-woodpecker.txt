Killi and Killan were two parakeets
who lived in a hole high up on a
silk-cotton tree. 
One day, a storm came and blew
down their tree. 
Killi and Killan cried birdy tears for
their lost home. 
A passing crow
heard the noise and asked why 
they were so sad.

      
“Our tree is gone, we have no home,” they sobbed.
“You need a bird who can peck wood to make a tree hole. Why don’t you ask the woodpecker to make you a new home?” said the crow.

          

      
So Killi and Killan set off to find the woodpecker.
Tiu Tiu
. Killi and Killan heard a loud 
sound from the bushes below.

          
“Are you the woodpecker? Can you make us a new tree hole?” they asked.

      
“No, I’m the 
tailorbird
. I stitch leaves together to make my nest.”

          
Pleased-to-meet-you!
 Killi and Killan heard a fluty whistle in the trees below.

      
“Are you the woodpecker? Can you 
make us a new tree hole?” they asked.

          
“No, I’m the 
bulbul
. I bring 
twigs 
to build a cup nest.”

      
Shichweeee shichweee
. Killi and Killan heard a screeching sound.
“Are you the woodpecker? Can you make us a new tree hole?” they asked.
“No, I’m the 
weaverbird
. I weave grass together to make my hanging nest.”
Ti-tee-too-wit
? Killi and Killan looked down in the grass.
“Are you the woodpecker and can you make us a new tree hole?” they asked.
“No, I’m the
 lapwing
. I make my nest on the ground.”

          
“We’ll never have a home again” said Killi.
“Don’t give up hope” said Killan. “Let’s try a little longer.”

      

          

          

          

          

          
Toktok-toktok
! Killi and Killan saw a bird hammering at a tree branch.
“Are you the woodpecker? Can you make us a new tree hole?” they asked.


“
Yes, I am,
”
 
said the 
woodpecker
, 


“
but I'm busy making my own nest.
You'll have to ask someone else.
”

The parakeets looked at each other 
in despair.





      

      

      

      

      

          
Tuk..tuk..tuk
! On a nearby tr
ee was a round green bird. 
“I can help you,” she said.
“Who are you?” sobbed Killi and Killan.
“I’m the 
barbet
,” said the bird. “I make my nest in trees by pecking out a nice round hole. I can make a new tree hole for you.”

      
And so she did.
