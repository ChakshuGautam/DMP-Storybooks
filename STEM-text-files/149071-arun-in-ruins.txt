          
Arun inspected the statue
in the abandoned palace.
He plucked the jewel out
of the statue’s forehead.
His pet skink, Arunachalam, hung on tight.

      

          
Gadagadagadagada! 
The pillars began to shake.
Radaradaradarada! 
The walls shivered.
Karaak!
 The floor cracked.
The door behind him closed with a 
DHUD!

      
“How dare you take my pottu?” 
boomed a voice
from the statue. 
“Give it back to me.”
Arun was so scared that his arms and legs 
turned to semiya. The jewel slipped out of 
his fist and shattered into many pieces.

          
“The light from that jewel held
the door open,” the statue said.
“The jewel will take years to grow back.
Now you can never leave.”
Arun looked at the broken jewel in panic.
“There must be some other way.”

      
“There is one other way, but you must hurry.”
The statue closed its eyes. 
“Wake up!” Arun punched the statue’s chest,
scattering centuries of dust into the air.

          
“Look, Arunachalam, there’s a note here!
It says that to open the door, we have to
complete the circuit. Here’s what we need:
The hair of a current creature
to power the circuit,
A hair clip from the resisters
to control the current flow,
A jewel from the upstairs place
to emit light
And feathers from a wirebird
to connect everything together.
I wonder what a current creature
looks like. I bet it’s small and fuzzy!”

      

          
Suddenly Arun heard growling behind him.
It was the current creature, ice blue with anger.
It was neither small 
nor fuzzy.
“Good doggie! 
Nice doggie!” 
Arun stammered.
Then he swiftly 
plucked a hair from 
the creature’s eyebrow.

      

          
“Raar raar raar raar raar 
raar raar!”
the current creature snarled,
ready to pounce. 
“HELP!” Arun cried.

      

          
Three girls appeared out of nowhere
and swatted the creature’s nose.
“Arf-arf!” The current creature
lowered its tail and ran away.
“Thanks a lot!” Arun said, to the girls.
“But why are you so tall?”
“Er,” they replied “Why are you so short?”
“I don’t have time to waste,” Arun rolled
his eyes. “I need to find the resisters.”
The girls laughed. “We are the resisters.”
“Oh!” Arun smiled. 
“Can I have your
hair clip please?”
“You can have it if you can reach it.”

      

          
Arun hopped and jumped and leaped. 
But he was still too short to reach their heads. 
“I’m sorry for calling you too tall!” Arun said, 
out of breath. 
The sisters grinned and handed Arun one hair clip. He thanked them, and then asked, “Is that the upstairs place?” 
“The upstairs place! You mustn’t go there,” 
said the resisters. “The wirebird pecks anyone 
who goes there.”
“A bird?” Arun laughed, “I’m not afraid 
of a silly bird.”

      

          
Arun and Arunachalam climbed up
to the jewels around the wirebird’s nest. 
Arun grabbed a jewel but dropped it to catch
a baby wirebird that had wandered too close
to the edge.

      

          
“Ka kaaaaa!” The mother wirebird swooped down 
and grabbed Arun by the shoulder.
“Put me down!” Arun yelled, clutching a clump 
of the bird’s feathers. “I was helping.”
The wirebird dropped him.
“Argh! I can’t believe we lost the jewel!”
Arun said.

      
“Click… click… click…”
Arunachalam grinned.
The jewel in his mouth sparkled.
They ran past the upstairs place,
past the three resisters and
past the current creature.
At last they were
in front of the statue.
Arun pinned the jewel
to the statue’s chest.
He fixed the resisters’
hair clip 
under the jewel.

          
He peeled out two wires
from the wirebird’s feather.

      
He pinned one under the jewel and the other next to the hair clip. “Why isn’t the light turning on?”

          
 Then, all at once, he remembered. He touched the hair
of the current creature to the open wire.

      

          
FLASH!
 It was the brightest light Arun had ever seen.
The palace door swung open.

      

          
“We did it! The statue is
going to reward us!”

      
“GET OUT!”
the statue roared.

          
Arun and Arunachalam
dived out the door.
Gadagadagadagada!
The pillars began to shake.
Radaradaradarada!
The palace walls trembled.
Kaaaarrraaaaaaak!
The palace crumbled
into ruins.

      

          
“No one’s going to believe what happened, Arunachalam,”
Arun said. 
“We don’t have a single jewel!”
“Click… click… click…” Arunachalam smirked. The jewel in his mouth sparkled.

      

          
What is an electronic circuit?
An electronic circuit is a path through which an electric current can flow. 
It has components such as a
battery, resistors and LEDs that are connected by wires. 
Electronic circuits are built to do certain tasks,
for example, the task of an LED circuit 
is to make the LED glow.
To make your own LED circuit, you will need:

      

          

          
1. An LED (light emitting diode)
An electronic component that produces light
when current flows through it.

      

      

          
2. A resistor
An electronic component used
to reduce the flow of current.

      

          
3. Two wires
Wires are metal threads covered with plastic,
used to carry the electric current.

      

          
4. A nine-volt battery
The component that supplies
power to the circuit.

      

          
5. A breadboard
A platform upon which to build the circuit.

      
Build your own electronic circuit
Note: Make sure you have an adult or teacher around when you are trying out this experiment.
Step 1

          
Fix the LED to the breadboard.

      

          

          
Step 2

      

          
Pin the resistor to
the long leg of the LED.

      

          
Step 3

      

          
Pin one wire next to the short leg of the LED and one wire right next to the resistor.

      
Step 4

          
Connect the wire next to the short leg of the LED to the negative side of the battery.

      
Step 5

          











Connect the wire next to the resistor to the positive side

of the battery. 


      
Step 6

          
When the light turns on, your electronic circuit is complete!
