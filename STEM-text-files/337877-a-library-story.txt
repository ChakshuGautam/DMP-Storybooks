Seema is very excited her school

will finally have a library.












“We have 60% of the funds but we need

to raise 40% more,” Leela Ma’am, the maths

teacher, tells Seema and her friends.












Leela Ma’am had recently started

teaching the children percentages.












“What does 40% mean, Ma’am?”

Seema asks.












“It means 40 out of one hundred.”

40
100
_____
x 100 = 40











“Ma’am, how do we calculate how much money 40% is?” asks Meera.


          











Leela Ma’am tells the children that they need Rs 5,000

to set up a library. 


“I
f Rs 5,000 is 100%, can you tell how

many hundreds would that include?” she asks.


      











“50 hundreds,” says

Seema immediately.

5000
100
______
= 50











The children get into a group and begin

calculating the amount they need to collect.












“If we take 40 for every 100, for 50 hundreds,

we get 50 times 40, which is 2,000. So we need

Rs 2,000,” says Seema.

40% of 100 =
40
100
____
x 100 = 40 x 1 = 40
40% of 5000 =
40
100
____
x 5000 = 40 x 50 = 2000











Seema and her friends have got a plan.

They decide to do a sale of home-made

snacks during tiffin time.












Meera will get samosas, Jayant will get bhel,

Priya will get chaat, Seema will get idlis.












The children collect the money and give it 
to Leela Ma’am. 
“Can we choose some of the 
books in the library?” asks Seema.
“Of course!” smiles Leela Ma’am.
