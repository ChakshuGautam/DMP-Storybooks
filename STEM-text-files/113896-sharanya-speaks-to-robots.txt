How to Code a Robot


The brain of a robot is a computer.

To communicate with computers

and give them tasks to do, we need to

know how to speak their language.


The code-based language that computers

understand is called a programming language.

And the person who writes code to communicate

with machines is called a programmer. There are many
programming languages to help us talk to computers.
Some of them are C, C++ and Java. 


Would you like to talk to computers too?
