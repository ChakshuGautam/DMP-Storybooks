          
Shiro turns eight tomorrow. He will celebrate with hot gulab jamuns, 
rainbow-coloured ice cream, and a volcano-shaped chocolate lava cake.
Shiro can’t take his eyes off the gulab jamuns. When no one’s looking, he eats one.
Then he eats another, and another, 
and another. Soon, all the 
gulab jamuns are gone!

      
“Ahh! That’s too much food!” Mouth is scared to see so many gulab jamuns tumbling in.
But together with the salivary glands, 
it chews and pushes the food down the throat.
The chewed-up food slides down the slippery oesophagus…  
and reaches the stomach. It bubbles like a cauldron with digestive juices.

          
“Here, you take care of it!” Stomach passes the mushy 
food to the small intestine.

      
“Help me with this!” The small intestine calls  out to its big brother, the large intestine, which absorbs all the water and nutrients. 

It sends the undigested remnants to the end of the line…


where it is sent out of Shiro’s body.
Now Shiro eyes the chocolate lava cake. 
He can hardly wait for his birthday!
Digestion
The human digestive system is made up of different parts — the mouth, salivary glands, oesophagus, stomach, liver, small and 
large intestine, rectum, colon and anus. Together these 10 organs work 
to process and digest the food we eat.

Food passes through the oesophagus

      

5

Food mixes with digestive juices and is broken down into energy by the stomach and liver
6

Processed food passes through the small and large intestines where nutrients and water are absorbed
