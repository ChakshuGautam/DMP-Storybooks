Ready or not, here I come! 


I love playing hide-and-seek in Mai’s colony.

So many secret spots to hide in, and I know them all. Mai built this colony years ago.

I have to hide before Prema finds me.













Mai made this bamboo bridge when Mama was little. Crossing the bridge is the safest way to reach school in the rainy season. That is when the stream gets rough.


Now it’s summer, and the stream is just a trickle. So under the bridge is the 

perfect place to hide.


But the cobwebs can make you sneeze.

Aa...

Oops, I think Prema heard me.



          











This basket has a great view.

I can see Paalamma feeding her cows.


We built that cob cowshed last year.

Mai showed us how to mix mud, straw and lime. Prema and I got really messy.


     
      
Ou
ch!
 An ant bit my bum.

               Time to find a new spot.



      

          
          











The library is our favourite place.

I love the wind tower.


Mai built this so that hot air can escape and the library and the books remain cool.


      
      
 
I can spot Prema heading this way.
 












Prema will never find me in this storeroom in Mai’s office. The office is the first building that Mai built.


She added something called a skylight to the roof so that the sunlight can stream in. 


			











Mai’s old things are on this shelf.

And these rolled-up sheets are drawings for new houses. Mai calls them blueprints.


Uh
 oh
, 
I can hear Prema’s jingling anklet. 
The store room door is opening!












“Ha, Gopi! I caught you!”




		

			










Mai is an architect. 

She makes big homes and small homes. She makes big offices and tiny offices.


She sketches and makes 

drawings of how these 

buildings will look.


If you wish to become an architect like Mai, you will have to study science, maths and architecture.
