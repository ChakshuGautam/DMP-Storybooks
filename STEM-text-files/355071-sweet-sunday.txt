It’s the first day of the holidays.
Maa calls Simran, Jeet and Veer and tells
them she has a treat planned for them.
“Go to Manjit Paaji’s shop and buy any two things that each of you likes,” she says.
The siblings are thrilled and after lunch, they set out for the sweet shop.
Simran chooses phirni, 
Jeet chooses toshe and 
Veer wants jalebi.
Manjit Paaji weighs the sweets.
The children watch as
he measures and packs
them in boxes.
He says that the 
jalebi weighs 200 
gms, 
the phirni weighs 250 gms 
and 
the toshe is 500 gms.
“Ma said we are allowed two
things each,” says Simran.

          


Simran chooses samosa. 


      


Jeet chooses mathri and
Veer takes kachori.


This time, Manjit Paaji
   weighs the salty stuff.
He tells the children that
   the samosas weigh 500 gms,
     the mathri is also 500 gms and
       the kachoris weigh 300 gms.
They run home and Ma asks them what they have bought.

          
The children say that each of them has bought
a different mix of sweet and salty treats.
Jeet’s treats weigh a kilo,
Simran’s weigh 750 gms and
Veer’s weigh 500 gms.
Everyone gets busy
enjoying the feast.

      
The holidays have begun well!

          
1 kg = 1,000 gms
500 gms + 500 gms = 1,000 gms = 1 kg
250 gms + 500 gms = 750 gms = 0.75 kg
200 gms + 300 gms = 500 gms = 0.5 kg
