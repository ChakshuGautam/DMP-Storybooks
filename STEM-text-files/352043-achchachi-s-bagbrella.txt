“Lost your umbrella

again?” asked Achchachi.












“I was very careful

this time. I think

I left it on the bus,”

replied Sahyadri.












“Please don’t tell Amma!” said Sahyadri.

“But now I need a new umbrella.”












“OK, we don’t have to tell her,”

replied Achchachi. “Let’s see if

we can make a new one.”












“I think we have everything 
we need,” 
said Achchachi, 
digging into his toolbox.












“But what about

the cloth for the

umbrella?” asked

Sahyadri.


          











“Look inside that box and

pick whatever colour you

like,” said Achchachi.


      











“These are so

colourful!” said

Sahyadri.












“But we don’t have enough

to make one umbrella,” said

Achchachi.












“But we can make a colourful

one by combining all the

different colours,”

said Sahyadri.












“Do you want a red one

with a bit of yellow? It’ll

look like the sunset,”

said Achchachi.












“But look! This purple

one is so beautiful,”

said Sahyadri.












“Let’s add more colours!”

said Sahyadri.












“Hmm... I think it

needs a little more

colour,” said Sahyadri.












“A red semicircle

would be perfect.”












“How about a

bit of green?”












“Let’s try some pink.












“Some orange.












“And maybe

some vermilion.”












Finally, after adding and removing, increasing

and decreasing, arranging and rearranging,

Sahyadri and Achchachi were all set.












Achchachi snipped, snapped, clipped,

taped, and burned the midnight oil…












and made the umbrella just in time for

school the next morning.












On their way, it began to rain. Sahyadri tugged

at the plug Achchachi had fixed to her bag.

ZAP!
 
Sahyadri’s Pie Chart


          











All the pieces of cloth in the

umbrella come together to

form a pie chart. A pie chart

is a circular diagram used to

represent data. A chart makes

it faster and easier to

understand data as compared

to numbers. Pie charts are

divided into slices to show all

the parts within one large unit.

In Sahyadri’s umbrella, all the

colours are used equally.
