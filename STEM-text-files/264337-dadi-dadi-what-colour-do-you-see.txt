​“Come, buy chashmas, colourful and bright.
See the world in a whole new light.”



          


​“Come on, Dadi, let’s play a guessing game.
We’ll point at a colour, you tell us its name.”


      

          


​“Hurry up, Dadi, let’s start soon!”


      

          

          
“What’s the colour of this balloon?”


      

      

          


​“This is easy. It’s green, I see.”    


      

          
“No, Dadi, that’s not true! 

      
 
This balloon is bright blue.”


          

          
“What colour is your gola, Dadi?”


      

      

          
“This is easy, it’s orange, I see.”

      

          


​“No, Dadi, that’s not true.
It’s flaming red all the way through.”



      


​“Guddu and Golu,
Now you give it a try.
What colour is that kite,
Up there, flying so high?”



          

      

          


​“That’s easy, Dadi, it’s purple, see?”  



      

          


​“No, children that’s not true.
Can't you see, it's bright blue?”



      

          


​How did Dadi, Guddu and Golu see so many colours?
