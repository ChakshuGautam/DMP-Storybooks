“POOOOOOOST!”
Who could that be from, wonders Lenin.
“Ah, from Rajan Maama!”
Two of my friends will be passing through Madurai on the 12th of April. They need a place to rest for a while. They should reach your house by 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I know you will look after them well.
Love,
Maama
Dear Lenin,

          

            
Today is the 12th of April, a hot and muggy day.
"Pchaa! Needs more sugar.”

        

      
Krinnnggg!
 
The doorbell rings loudly.

            
Slurrrp!
 

        

          
“
Oh, hello! Hello! Please come inside,” says Lenin.

      
“Please have some lime juice.”
 
“Oh no! I’m so sorry. I’ll be right back,” says Lenin. 

          
Clang! Dhadam! Toing!
“Oh, what shall I serve the juic
e in? Ah, this and this!”

      
“Try this! You must be so thirsty.”
“OH NO!”
“I’m so sorry. I’ll be right back.”
“Please have your juice now!”
“Oh no! I’m so sorry. I’ll be right back.”
GLUG! GLUG!
  

            
GLUG!
GLUG!
 

        
If these animals joined Lenin's juice party, what would he serve them juice in?
