Banko has been saving money.

          


He wants to donate it to Power Paws
because he loves animals.



      

			
“Sunkho, wait, I’m
counting… 1, 2, 3, 4,”
Banko says.
“Banko, one 10-rupee
note plus one 1-rupee
coin is not equal to two
rupees. You have to count
the value of the money,”
says Daee.
“Let us first make
different piles.”

		

          
“So many coins!”
“Don’t worry, Banko. I will give you a 10-rupee note in 
exchange 
for your twenty 50-paise coins,” 
says Daee.

      
1 x 50 Paise = 1/2 Rupee
2 x 50 Paise = 1 Rupee
20 x 50 Paise = 10 Rupees
“Banko, how many
10-rupee notes do 
you 
have?”
“Twenty-five,” says Banko
“That makes it Rs250,”
says Daee.

          
“Banko, now give me all your 10-rupee notes.”
Daee then takes out some notes from her purse.
“A 100-rupee note, and three 50-rupee notes in exchange for your 
10-rupee notes. 
How much is it, Banko?”

      

          
“Ummm...is it Rs250, Daee?” asks Banko.
“Yes!” says Daee.

      

          











Four 5-rupee coins 

Fifteen 2-rupee coins 

Fifty 1-rupee coins 

One 100-rupee note 

Three 50-rupee notes

Total  


      

          











Rs20.00

Rs30.00 

Rs50.00 

Rs100.00 

Rs150.00

Rs350.00 


      











How much money has Banko saved in notes and coins? 

“Now Banko, altogether
you have Rs350. If you
give Rs250 to Power
Paws, you will still have
Rs100 left. What do you
want to do with it?” Daee
asks.
“We’ll get a big football
for us and a small one for
Sunkho!” says Banko.
