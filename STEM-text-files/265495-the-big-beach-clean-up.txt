Arzu loved the beach more than 
any 
other place in the world.




There, she could watch her 
favourite animal,




play her favourite game




and have her 
favourite drink, 
coconut water.




She would go as often as she could with 
her best friend, Umeed. One afternoon, they 
found Thatha decorating his coconut stall.
“Thatha, which beach is this?” asked Arzu, 
pointing at a photograph.
“It’s so clean and beautiful!” said Umeed.


Thatha told them how he grew up on 
this very beach. He would play barefoot 
and take naps on the sand without having 
to worry about pieces of glass or garbage.
“It was heaven! It pains me that you will 
never see it like that.”  




The next day in school, Arzu told her
entire class about Thatha’s old photos and 
stories. She described how beautiful the 
beach once was. “We have to do something! 
And I have a plan.”
Everyone wanted to help!




Arzu showed them the map she had
made. She had drawn the whole beach and 
divided it into four equal parts or quarters.
The plan was to divide themselves into four 
equal teams.
Since there were 16 children in the class, 
this meant that each team would have four
 children. Each team would collect and 
separate garbage from one quarter of the 
beach.




“Arzu, maybe each team can also be
divided into two equal parts? One half of 
the team can collect garbage and the other 
half can separate it,” said Dia.
“That’s a great idea!” Arzu replied. “Half of four
 is two. So, two of us will collect and two will 
separate.”




“Wow, I never thought we’d use all this 
maths class stuff to solve real problems,” said 
Umeed.
“Why do you think we’re learning maths?” 
asked Arzu, giggling.




On Saturday, which was also Thatha’s day 
off, all the children got together at the 
beach. They divided their tools into 
four equal parts.

At sunset, Abu arrived as promised with 
the garbage truck. He weighed all the 
sacks before loading them. The children 
had collected 120kg of garbage!
“There are 30kg of glass and paper, 
which can be recycled,
”
 he said.
“30kg out of 120kg, that’s one quarter!” 
said Arzu.



      


“That leaves 90kg, which means that 
three quarters of the garbage is plastic,” 
said Umeed.


“Yes,” said Abu. “We will take it and 
separate it further to see what can be 
recycled or reused. The rest will go to 
the landfill.”




On Sunday morning, 
everyone arrived 
early 
and waited for Thatha.



          


Thatha’s eyes teared up. This time with 
happiness. “I did not think it was possible!” 
he said.
Arzu smiled her biggest smile. “Anything 
is possible, Thatha! All it took was some 
muscle power...”



      


“And some maths!” Umeed said, laughing.


SURPRISE!


What are fractions?
A fraction represents part of a whole.
If we divide the whole into two equal parts, each part is 1⁄2 or half.
If we divide the whole into four equal parts, each part is 1⁄4 or a quarter.


Find some fractions with Arzu and Umeed
Arzu and Umeed have been monitoring plastic waste in the bins. One week, 
this is what they found.

          


1. What fraction of the waste is water bottles?
2. What fraction of the waste could be reduced 
if all the stalls kept paper straws?
3. What fraction of the waste could be reduced 
if everyone carried their own reusable bottles 
and bags?
