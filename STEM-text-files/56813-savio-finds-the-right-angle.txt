“Fatima, let's go out and play. Today is Sunday!” says Savio.
“Savio, stop that noise right now! I have to finish my homework on right angles.”
“Right angles? What are those? Are there wrong angles too?”

		
“There are no wrong angles. But a right angle looks like… this!”
“Hmm… like Pappa’s ‘L’ board?” asks Savio.
“Exactly!” says Fatima. She wonders why she hadn’t thought of that before. “Two lines from the same point, like this.”
“There’s a right angle cross on Betul Church!” shouts Savio.
“Super, Savio! Let’s go find some more,” says Fatima.
“Right angle lamp posts!” shouts Savio.
“Right, right, keep finding more right angles,” says Fatima.
“Beach chairs!” shouts Savio.
“
Shhhh!
” 
“Not the chairs, Savio,” whispers Fatima, “but the 
uncle and aunty do form a right angle each.” 
Savio bursts 
into giggles.
At the beach, Fatima runs towards her friends who are playing volleyball.
Savio follows her. “Look Fatima, so many 
right 
angles on the net.”
Fatima starts playing too. 
Savio is bored.
“Fatima, let’s go!”
She does not pay attention.
“Fatima, right angle on the clock!”
“Oh ho, six fifteen already,” says Fatima. 
Savio 
and Fatima say bye to their friends, 
and run home.

          
Their mother has left a large plate of dodol to cool on the table.
“So many right angles,” says Savio.
“Stop showing off, Savio!" 
says Fatima, "
Leave me alone to finish 
my homework."

      
How many right angles 
can you spot in this picture?
