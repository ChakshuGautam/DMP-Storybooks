Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?




I was just here. 
Didn’t you see my watery trail by the lake? 
I took a nap in the cool water.



Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?




I was just here. 
Didn’t you see my pugmarks on the soft soil?
Look hard, I could be coming or going!


          
Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?

      

          

          
I was just here. 
Didn’t you see my claw marks on the tree?
I was marking my territory

      

      
Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?


I was just here. 
Didn’t you smell my scent on the rock?
The spray helps a tigress find me!

Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?
I was just here. 
Didn’t you see what 
I ate yesterday?
The hair and nails 
should give you a clue.
Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?

          
I was just here. 
Didn’t you hear that loudmouth l
angurs' warning?
They told the entire forest 
where I was.

      
Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?
I was just here. 
Didn’t you hear my growl?
I want other tigers to know that this part of the forest 
is mine.

          
Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?

      

          
I was just here. 
Didn’t you see my false eyes?
I tricked you.

      

          
Tiger, Tiger,
where are you?

      
Here I am.
You found me.
Meet Mujahid and his Team Members

          
Researchers at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, 
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, attempt to understand living systems. Mujahid is a part of the Ranthambore Tiger 
project, where Uma Ramakrishnan (Senior Fellow, DBT 
Wellcome India Alliance, NCBS) and her group (Anubhab Khan and Kaushal  Patel) are trying to understand the genetic impacts of isolation and inbreeding on endangered species. This is why he spends a lot of time tracking tigers - through their pugmarks, claw marks, and scat!
