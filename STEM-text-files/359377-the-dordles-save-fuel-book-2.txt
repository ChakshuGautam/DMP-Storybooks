The Dordles were lost and needed to get home.

They had used up all the coal, wood and oil they had collected.

Now they needed to find and use fuel smartly.












They learned that coal came from

animal bones and plants, kept under

pressure for millions of years.












But there was very little coal left on

Earth. So they came up with a plan.












Dordle B, the oldest Dordle, left to get firewood.

He only used fallen branches, and

planted more trees when he was done.












Dordle D, the brightest Dordle, turned off all the lights

on the ship to save energy.












While Dordle E, the youngest Dordle, buried a bone he found,

with the hope of it turning into coal.












The Dordles looked for other ways to save fuel.












They replaced things that were broken

and things that used too much energy.












They cycled and walked when

they searched for fuel.












They even found bio-waste

and turned it into biofuel.












The Dordles had collected more fuel than before.

They were sure that they would be able to leave the

planet this time. They started their engines, put on

their seatbelts, and their ship zoomed into the sky.












Tired and hungry, the Dordles knew

what to do next. They ate till their

tummies touched their necks.












This time, the Dordles got

far, but not far enough.












What Are Fossil Fuels?












Fossil fuels are fuels that were formed from the buried remains of

plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. They are found

naturally under the earth, and are the most-used fuels in the world.

Fuels such as coal, crude oil and natural gas are all considered fossil

fuels because they originally came from fossils.

Fossil fuels are limited in quantity, because it takes millions of

years to make them. They are also bad for the environment.

Burning fossil fuels produces too much carbon dioxide. This leads

to global warming and the melting of the ice caps, causing the

oceans to rise and climate change to speed up.

Luckily, just like the Dordles, the world is looking to

reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and switch to

fuels that are clean and safe for the environment.
