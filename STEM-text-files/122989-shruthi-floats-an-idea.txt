“It’s Grow a Plant Month, everyone!”

Sukanya Miss said.


Everyone in the class
was excited.


Everyone but Shruthi.


          











Shruthi hated the soil. She did not like touching it.

She did not like the earthworms that wriggled in it.

And she hated how the soil made her hands feel icky.


      











“How was your day, Shruthi?” Appa asked.


Shruthi dropped to the floor. “We have to grow

a plant, Pa, and I hate touching soil!”


“You don’t need soil to grow plants,” Appa replied.


          











“But plants need air, water, soil and sunlight to grow!”

said Shruthi. “Sukanya Miss told us that they get

all their nutrients from the soil.”


      

          











“You’re right,” Appa replied.

“But plants can also get their

nutrients from water, like a

lotus in a pond.”


      











“Can I really grow a plant in
water?” Shruthi asked.


“Yes,” Appa replied. “All you need
is a sapling,

some coconut husk,
a big plastic bottle and

some
plant 
nutrients to help it grow.”

Appa cut a bottle in two halves.












Shruthi filled the bottom half
with water and mixed in
some nutrients.












She flipped the top half of the bottle
and put the coconut husk in it.


          











Finally, she placed the sapling in the top half.


      











Shruthi took care of her plant every day.












Three weeks later,
she took her plant to class.

Everyone was surprised.
“Shruthi, how is your plant
so big?” 
Sukanya Miss
asked.


“It’s because I grew it in
water, Miss!”

Shruthi replied.












No one in her class had seen
a plant grown in water
before. No one even knew
it was possible.


“Your plant is so beautiful, Shruthi!”

her classmate said.
Shruthi was prouder than ever.












How did Shruthi grow her plant in water?


Shruthi grew her plant using hydroponics.
Hydroponics is the method of growing plants in water.


Plants need air, water, sunlight and
 nutrients (salts and minerals) to grow.

When they are planted in the ground,

they gather their nutrients from the soil.

But when plants are grown in water, nutrients have to be fed to them.  


Shruthi gave her plant all the nutrients 
it needed, and made sure that it had
enough water, sunlight, air and space
 to grow.


Would you like to grow a plant in water,

just like Shruthi?
