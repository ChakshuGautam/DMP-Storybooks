If Monday were a man,
he would be a school principal.
He would have eyebrows like caterpillars,
and a voice as hard as a hammer.
“Wake up. It is time to work,” he would say.



​When Monday comes, I want to hide.



          


​If Tuesday were a woman, she would be an old aunty.
Her saree would be the colour of dust. 
She would visit every week. 
She would drink tea
and talk, 
talk
, 
talk
.


      

          


​We would yawn and wait for her to go.
Tuesday is the slowest day of the week.


      

          


​If Wednesday were a girl, she would wear purple spectacles.
She would wear a neat uniform, and have three sharpened pencils.
She would solve her sums, drink her milk, 
and pack her school bag.


      

          


​Wednesday is a busy day.


      

          


​If Thursday were a boy,
he would wear a yellow T-shirt.


His head would be full of
gymnastics and lollipops.



      


​He would jump and run.
He would be in a hurry.



​On Thursday, I make happy plans. 



​​If Friday were an older sister,
she would be getting ready to meet her friends.
She would laugh and she would giggle.

          


She would wear stars in her ears
and have stars in her eyes.



      


​Sometimes I wish every day was a Friday.


      


​If Saturday had a twinkly smile,
it would be just like my best friend.
We would play hopscotch.
We would read books.
We would sit and watch the rain together.
I wish Saturdays would never end.


          


​Sunday would be a bald grandfather.
He would eat, sleep and tell stories.


      

          


​He would be jolly in the morning,
but cross in the evening.


      


​On Sunday, I wash my hair.
And try not to think about Monday.

MONDAY

​Which is your favourite day of the week?
