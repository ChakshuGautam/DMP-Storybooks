Meet Akara and Linio. They are straight lines.
Akara is a standing line.
Linio is a sleeping line. 
Come on, let’s meet some of their other line friends!
See these curved lines? They are Archit and Squiggles.
This is Slopes! Slopes is a slanting line.
What are these friends going to do today?
They are going to make animal shapes together.
Look at this dog! Can you spot Linio?
Wow, look at this elephant! Where is Archit, can you see?
Hey, it’s a turtle! Can you spot Squiggles?
What a lovely snail! And there’s Slopes, can you see?
Woohoo, an owl! Where’s Akara?
Shhh!
 The lines are all resting now.
Making animal shapes is fun, but tiring!
