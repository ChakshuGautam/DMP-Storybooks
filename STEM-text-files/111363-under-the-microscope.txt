Microbes Are Everywhere!
Hydras look like plants, tardigrades walk like tiny bears and amoebas 
are shapeshifters. But what they have in common is that they’re all 
microbes, tiny creatures that live all around us. 
From deep under the earth to far up in the sky, microbes are everywhere. 
They live in the freezing cold and in the bubbling heat. 
They live in food, waste, rocks, trees, soil, and even you and me. 
So how many microbes live around us? A drop of water from a pond 
will have hundreds and hundreds of these tiny creatures! But to look 
at them, we’ll need to use a microscope. A microscope is a device 
used to enlarge very small things that can’t be seen with the naked eye.

      

          
Let’s take a closer look!

      

          

          
Hydras can grow back their lost body 
parts and almost never die of old age.  

      

      
If you cut a planaria into two, 
each piece will develop 
into an individual planaria.
Euglenas, like plants, can 
make their own food 
through photosynthesis.
Diatoms produce 
25 to 40 
percent of 
the air we breathe. 
Amoebas can change their
shapes. Sometimes, they 
do this to trap food. 
A single copepod can eat thousands 
of diatoms in just 24 hours.
Tardigrades can survive in the 
most extreme conditions, like inside 
a volcano or in outer space. 

          
Paramecia
 swim really fast 
and can cover a distance of 
four times their length in a second.

      
Cyanobacteria have been around 
for a very long time and have been 
found in fossils that are over a 
billion years old.
