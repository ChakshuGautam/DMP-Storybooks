Push the thrust lever
forward to power up the
flight engines.

          
Now pull the joystick down
to lift the aeroplane into
the air.

      

          
Congratulations, Captain!
We're up in the air.

      
Uh-oh! Stormy skies ahead.
Pick up the phone to make a
passenger announcement.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please tighten your seatbelts. We are soon going to experience a bit of turbulence."
Let us avoid the storm clouds by
pulling the joystick to the left.

          

          
Push the joystick to the right
to move the plane to the right.

      

      

          
Good! This made the aeroplane turn left.

      
Good job, Captain! We flew around the storm instead of through it.

          
And we're near the end
of our journey.

      
Let's head to the airport by
pushing the joystick forward.
This points the nose of the
plane downward.

          
Our plane is almost at it's destination.

      

          
Pull the lever to let out
the landing gear. 

      

          
The landing
wheels are out.

      

          

          
Good job, Captain!
The plane is on the ground.
Finally step on the rudder
pedals to bring the aeroplane
to a smooth stop.

      

      
Nice landing, Captain.
See you on our next flight!
Build your own cockpit
Pilots learn and practice flying aeroplanes using devices called simulators. A simulator is like
a video game–it creates the experience of flying a plane without actually stepping inside one.
You can also practice flying a plane by building your own simulator. All you need are this book
and some common objects to get you started. You can use your school bag as the pilot's seat,
a clip board as your flight screen, your lunch box as the thrust lever, a water bottle as a
joystick and a pair of slippers as the rudder pedals.
Let your imagination soar and let's fly a plane!
