On their first day at kindergarten, Afzal, Bhagya, Vani and George planted a grafted mango sapling each in their backyards.
Now they have just completed Class 4 and the mango trees have given them a grand gift for the summer holidays. Lots of delicious, juicy fruit.
They count the fruits from each of their trees. Each has the same number of fruits. One hundred and fifty!











Afzal starts adding,

“150 + 150 + ...”


          











Bhagya says,

“
Multiply
, silly. That is quicker.”


      
“Right,” says Afzal. “One hundred and fifty into four...” 
“Is six hundred,” says George.

          











150 x 4 = 600


      
“Let’s share this with all the children in our village since this is our first harvest,” says Vani.











“Great idea!” the others agree.

“Six hundred mangoes, a hundred and fifty children. We’ll call them all to school. Then, we will give each one a mango and repeat till the mangoes are over,” says Afzal.











“That will take too long. Let’s use 
division
.

Six hundred divided by one hundred and fifty.

That’s four mangoes each,” says Vani quickly.












600 ÷ 150 = 4












Multiplication and division are best

friends. Where there is multiplication,

there is some division too!












10 x 45 = ?

450 ÷ ? = 10

? ÷ 10 = 45
