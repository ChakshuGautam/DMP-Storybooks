She looks down from the terrace and stomps her feet.
Oh-ho! When will Kulfi Kaka come to her street?








      

      

      

          


















Trunn trunn trunn, she hears a bell ring.
Bhanwari runs with her little pouch.



      


















“How many would you like
today, child?” 


Kulfi Kaaka asks, gently.

          

          
"Mummy and Papa will have one kulfi each, 
Babloo will hav
e one too.”

      

      

          
She counts on her fingers, "One plus one plus one makes three. One kulfi costs five rupees. Three times five is fifteen."

      

          
“Nani will lie and say, 
‘No kulfi for me today’, 
But nani becomes a thief at night,
she will eat one with delight.”


















Kaaka asks, “So how many
kulfis does that make?”





      
Bhanwari thinks some more.
“Three and one make it four.
Five times four is twenty!”
“But what about YOU?” Kaaka laughs.
“I forgot about me! I want a kulfi too! 
Here, the price of five will be twenty-five.”

          
Just then, a crow snatches Bhanwari's treat and flies away!

      

          
“I only had twenty-five rupees,” 


Bhanwari says sadly
.

      

          


Kaaka says, “Don't worry, take this. A free kulfi
.”
This cheers up Bhanwari.



      


Trunn trunn trunn, off he goes.
More children await their treat.
