Patterns Are All Around Us












The day, the week, the month and the

year — all have patterns that repeat.

The seasons change every year and come

back the same way. Every year, winter is

followed by summer, which is followed

by the monsoon.

Look around you and try to spot these

patterns. Go back to the beginning of the

book and look for patterns you might

have missed.
