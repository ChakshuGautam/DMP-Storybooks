It was the beginning of October 
and everyone 
in Kheechan was 
waiting to feed and care for 
the 
cranes that visited them every year.












“Mama, when will the koonj

arrive?” Raju asked Bhanwar Ram.












“Beta, they will be here soon,”

said Bhanwar Ram. “By November.”


			











Raju began a countdown to the date of arrival. It would take about four weeks 
for the 
koonj to arrive from the Mongolian plains where they nested.












They would fly over the Central Asian plains and then over the Himalayas and

finally land in Kheechan.


		











A day went by.

Then two days, then five days.

In seven days, it had been a week.

7 days = 1 week













Then two, then three.

Soon it had been four weeks,

almost a full month.

14 days = 2 weeks = a fortnight

About 4 weeks = 1 month













How much longer would it
take for the birds to arrive?

Raju was growing impatient.












He had spent the month 
helping Bhanwar Mama 
stock 
up 
on grains for 
their feed.












Raju counted, a year has 12 months and 
the koonj usually stayed in Kheechan for five months. 
This meant they would be here 
until the 
end of March. He would get to spend 
almost half a year with them.












He would feed the

cranes, and look after

the wounded and tired

ones that had made the

long journey.

6 months = half a year

12 months = 1 year













Then one day, Raju looked up at

the sky. He saw hundreds of koonj

gliding and sailing, soaring and racing.












All the villagers ran out of their homes

with bags of millet and scattered it on

the ground. Raju ran to join them.

His friends were back home.

The Koonj Calendar











Every year, thousands of koonj, also known as demoiselle

cranes, migrate from their home in Central Asia to Kheechan

in Rajasthan and parts of Pakistan. They stay there for around

five months and the villagers feed them every day.
