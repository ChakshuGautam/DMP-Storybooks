It was a bright morning. The hungry myna

hopped with excitement. Time to feast on her

favourite food — the sun.












The sun? But how?












Isn’t it












too big?












Too hot?












Tooooooo far away?












The myna had a plan.












It started with the plants, who drank up golden sunshine through their

leaves. The sunlight, mixed with sweet morning air and cool water, made a

delicious meal for the plants. For extra flavour, there were snacks in the soil.












A prickly caterpillar crawled out of his egg. He was hungry enough to eat

the whole plant!

Leaf after leaf after leaf he gobbled, getting bigger and pricklier. The purple

leaves were his favourite — bitter and juicy with a spicy twist.












The caterpillar couldn’t eat another bite. He hid under a leaf and

wrapped himself up. After much tossing and turning, he was ready

to come out — as a moth!












Nearby, the gecko licked her

eyes clean to make sure she

was seeing right. Those wings

looked so soft!












These days, moths find it hard to see

the moon and stars at night. So, they

gather around light bulbs instead.

Hidden in the shadows, the gecko

couldn’t wait any longer. Her long,

sticky tongue flew out of her mouth

and caught the moth.












The wings melted in her

mouth. The bushy antennae

tickled her throat on the

way down. Delicious!












By morning, the gecko had tasted all kinds

of wings — soft, chewy, and even some

mouth-wateringly crisp ones. With each

meal, she grew bigger and rounder. Too full

to move, the gecko settled in for a nap.












The myna’s beak

dropped open. Those gecko

toes looked SO crunchy!












Crunchy toes

    soft wings

        juicy leaves

            and plenty of

                delicious sunshine












The myna gobbled up the gecko with a snap of her beak.












She saved the tail for last, which wiggled

and squiggled delightfully in her stomach.


          











The myna’s plan to eat

the sun had worked!


      
But she was still hungry...











Behind her, the hungry cat’s

whiskers quivered. Time to feast

on his favourite food, the sun.












The Food Chain


          











Every time you take a bite of food, you are eating the sun!

All living beings, including humans, need energy to grow.

This energy comes to our bodies through food.

Plants feed themselves by turning sunlight into food!

They pass the sun’s energy on to animals, like the caterpillar

who chomped up the plant’s leaves, or like us eating

vegetables. Some animals also depend on other animals for

energy, like the gecko who ate the moth, or us eating fish

curry for dinner.

This transfer of energy is called the food chain, and it begins

with the sun.


      











Other animals are hungry, too! Spiders love to eat moths, just as cats

love to eat geckos, grasshoppers eat plants and birds love to snack on

caterpillars. When food chains get all tangled up, the result is a food

web. Can you draw a food web from animals you see around you?












But where does a food chain, or food web, end? When

the last animal in a food chain reaches the end of its

life, it becomes food for worms, mushrooms and tiny

creatures like bacteria living in the soil. After

they are done, plants get the leftovers.

Nothing in nature is wasted!
