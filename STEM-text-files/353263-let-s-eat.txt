          











Some hunt, some pluck,

some simply swallow in a hurry.


      











What do animals like to eat?












Here comes the












cockroach.












Toothpaste on brush or rotting leaves,

she will eat anything that is around.












There goes the 
hare

at 
top speed.













He does not waste any nutrients.

After grasses and seeds, he also

eats his own poop.












Who is digging?












It is the 
beetle
, who buries

dead birds and rats. He is

storing food for his babies.












The 
crocodile
 is waiting to

eat his prey whole, even if

there is hair and bones.












The 
hyena

gives a gleeful laugh.












A carcass or just the

left toe, she is happy

to eat any leftovers.


          











The 
snake
 slides into

a hidey-h
O
le.
He doesn’t care for an
omelette, he gulps the
eggs whole.

      











The 
octopus

can change her colour.












Watch her drop down on a clam.

She pulls it into her arms and

mouth and then it is gone.












The 
leopard
 is out hunting at night.

She eats creatures big and small —

hares, jungle fowl, chital, rats.












Up on the tree, the grey

langur
 is combing her 
baby’s hair. She picks out 
lice and puts them in her 
mouth. 
Now that’s a 
crispy snack.












Leopards hunt, langurs pluck,

crocodiles simply swallow in a hurry.












Now we know what animals like for dinner,

what do you like to eat?
