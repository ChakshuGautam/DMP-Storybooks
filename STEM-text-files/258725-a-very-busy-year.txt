          
I don’t like my birthday.
I don’t like the day.
I don’t like the month.

      

          


​All months are special.
Except my month.



      

          


​January is as exciting as a 
new notebook.
It feels crisp and clean.
It is the first month of the year.



      

          


​February.
Later. Later. Later.



      

          


​March is as cheerful as a box of crayons.
Spring brings pink leaves on the peepal tree,
orange flowers on the gulmohar tree,
red pompoms on the ixora plants.


      

          


​​​April is as confused as a seesaw.
There are school exams and sweaty days.
But also juicy, golden Alphonso mangoes.


      


​May is as happy as a yellow butterfly.
The summer holidays are lazy and long.
There are cousins and cricket matches.
Train journeys and prickly heat.



​June is as suspenseful as a mystery book.
What will happen when school starts?
Will my best friend Renu be in my class?
Will mean Miss Menon be my class teacher?


          


​


July is like the dhishoom-crash-bang in a film.
The monsoons take over. Winds howl.
Clouds thunder and grumble.
My umbrella flies away.
Then mummy scolds and I sulk.



      


​August is as inspiring as Jana Gana Mana.
For Independence Day we march.
We paint flags green, orange and white.



​September is as busy as a concert.
Teachers’ Day is our favourite day.
Renu and I sing songs.
We make cards.
We make gulab jamuns.
All for Miss Menon. We love her now.


          


​October is as bright as a 
queen’s crown.
Diwali brings diyas, sparkly, shiny earrings and jootis and rangoli.
I eat too many laddoos.


      

          


​November is as cosy as my pink sweater.
Winter is slowly creeping in.
The days are short. The nights are cold.


      

          

          


​December is as chilly as a refrigerator.
I shiver for fun.
Even school days feel like holidays.
It is the last month of the year.
A new year is waiting.


      

      

          


​See.
All the months are special.
Except February.
February is boring and muddled.


      


​​​Other months have 30 or 31 days.
February has 28 days.
Then every four years it has an extra day.
29 February.

          


I was born on 29 February.
My birthday comes once every four years.



      


​I am upset.
Wouldn’t you be, too?
I would like to celebrate every year,
just like you do.
