“You climb the tree. It’s your turn!” says Arjun.


Pranav looks up at the tree, and says,

“Okay. I will go.”


“Can you see the ball?” Maansa shouts

from below.


But something else catches Pranav’s eye.


          











“Look! It’s a beehive!” Pranav cries.


Maansa looks worried. “What about all the bees?”


“Don’t worry, it’s empty,” says Pranav, peering at it.

“There are so many holes! And they’re all

the same shape…”


      











“Why did the bees choose this shape? Why not a circle?” Pranav wonders.
He imagines the hive in circles. 
“That would not work.”













“Bees are very clever,” Pranav tells his friends

the next day. He has been reading all about them.

“They have discovered the best shape for their home.

Hexagons come together with no holes or gaps,

just like a jigsaw puzzle.”


Their maths teacher, Mr Das,

overhears them. “The six sides

of the hexagon provide more room

for the bees,” he adds. 


“Where did they learn

how to do that?” asks Pranav. 


Mr Das says, with a smile,

“Patterns are everywhere!”












At the market the next day, Pranav looks carefully at the fruits and vegetables.

He looks at the pineapples, ridge gourds and the insides of oranges. 

So many sizes, colours, shapes... but Pranav can see the patterns! 

 

“Are patterns really everywhere?” he wonders.












Pranav becomes a pattern detective!












“There are so many things

in nature
that are created

using repeating patterns,”
Pranav tells his class

the next day.


“We use repeating patterns 
in our
man-made world as well,”

says Mr Das.
“Why don’t you

try to create something
using a pattern? That can

be your homework.”


“What shapes shall we use

to make
the pattern?”

Pranav asks.


Mr Das writes the answer

on the blackboard.












Use any shape you want.












At home, Pranav thinks about his homework.

He imagines making his own hive, perhaps with

squares. Or triangles.


He thinks about what Mr Das said. 
“Patterns are everywhere.”
Then, he starts seeing the patterns.












Carpet. Bookshelf. Windows. Patterns everywhere! 
Wherever he looks, he sees shapes coming together. 
“Bees are not the only clever ones,” Pranav thinks.

“We use shapes and patterns for so many things!”












And so Pranav gets busy

drawing his dream house.


Red rectangular bricks.

Black and white square tiles

at the entrance, like in his

grandmother’s house.


Who knew simple shapes

could make a home—for bees,

for me and for you!












Spot the Patterns
Nature has clever ways of taking shapes and

putting them together.
Pranav sees this in the

world around him: the outside of a pineapple,
the

inside of an orange, the hexagons of a beehive. 


Some shapes, like hexagons and squares,

fit together perfectly, leaving no gaps.
But others,

like circles, don’t. When shapes in nature fit

together in repeating patterns,
leaving no gaps

or holes, it is called tessellation.


Pranav sees that humans also use 
tessellation
.

We repeat shapes to form patterns, and use
these

patterns to design bookshelves, build castles and

create works of art.
A simpler word for tessellation is 
tiling
.
