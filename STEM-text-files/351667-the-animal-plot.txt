Bar Graphs
Bar graphs represent information using mathematical pictures. They are used to count and compare numbers and data, and show how things change with time. Bar graphs have an x-axis and a y-axis. One axis usually has a category (like types of animal) and the other has numbers, which we can use for counting (like the number of each type of animal). So, you can now add up all the animals and see how many there are. 
Take a look at the bar graphs, and answer these questions. 
1. Does Janu have more birds or buffaloes in Jind? 
2. Count the number of pigs and piglets in Ferozepur.
3. How many goats does Bela have in Bhopal?
4. How many camels, dogs, goats and birds are there on 
Pappu’s farm? 
5. How many ducks does Bunny have to feed every day?
