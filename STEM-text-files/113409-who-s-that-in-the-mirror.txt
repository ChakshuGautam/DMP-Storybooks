          
Amma had a new mirror. It wasn’t small like the bathroom mirror that Manasa was too short to see. This mirror was as tall as Amma. When Amma stood in front of it, another Amma looked back.
“Who is THAT?” Manasa shouted. 

      
“Come and see yourself, Manasa,” Amma said. Manasa moved in front 
of Amma, chomping a biscuit.
In the mirror, another Manasa’s
mouth opened and closed.
 

      
Manasa went around the house to the back 
of the 
mirror 
wall. She hit it. 
THUMP!
 
No extra Manasas there. 
“Hi Manasa,” Titus came running from his house. 

          
Titus followed Manasa back to 
the mirror. Manasa was getting 
angry now. 
She took the mirror off the wall 
and peered at the back. It was
just wood. No people hiding there.

      

          
Manasa walked around the mirror
and peeked. Maybe it wouldn’t 
see her.  
But no. There was Mirror Manasa,
looking sneaky.

      

          

          
﻿
Manasa stomped towards Mirror Manasa and lifted her leg high. 
﻿
“HAI YA!”
﻿
Mirror Manasa did 
the 
same thing. 
She didn’t 
look 
scared at all.
﻿
“I don’t like them,”
 Titus whined.

      

      
Manasa swung a cricket bat. It slipped from her hand 
and flew 
KRACK
 into Mirror Manasa’s face. 
CLINK! CLANK! CRASH!
 
Bits of mirror flew everywhere, glass flashing. 
Titus 
began to cry.

          
“Manasa!” Amma came running. “Don’t move! 
Don’t touch the glass. It’s dangerous!”
She picked Manasa up, and then Titus. She carried them
away from the broken mirror. Then Amma carefully swept 
the glass up.

      

          


“I was so angry,” Manasa told Amma in bed that night. 
“I don’t understand where Mirror Manasa came from!”
Amma drew a mirror. “See, it’s just glass. 
The shiny layer at the back? It turns light back to you. 
BOUNCE!
”
“You stand in front and the mirror will
BOUNCE you back as a picture.
”


      
Shiny 
Layer

Manasa

      
Mirror
Manasa looked at the picture. Manasa in, Manasa out. 
“Like a ball!” Manasa said. “BOUNCE!”
“Yes,” Amma nodded. “You show the mirror your face and 
the mirror bounces it back.”
“But no sound,” Manasa said. “Mirror Manasa didn’t speak.”
“No sound,” Amma said. “The shiny bit only bounces light, 
not sound or taste or smell.”


“So Mirror Manasa won’t be there in the dark?” Manasa asked.
“The mirror needs light to see, same as you,” Amma yawned.
“Aha!” Manasa was pleased. “That’s what Mirror Manasa is.
 Light bouncing.”
“Mmmm,” Amma said and fell asleep.
