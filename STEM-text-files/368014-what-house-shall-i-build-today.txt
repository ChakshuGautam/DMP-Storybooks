What house shall I build today?












A Toda hut with bamboo walls and a granite door?


          











A bhunga house made of mud?


      











A Kashmiri house with a wooden zoon dub balcony to stand in and wave at the moon from?


          











A kettuvallam with               wooden planks to 
    float on the water?


      











A Naga hut with roofs of tall wild grass?












How about a Jaisalmer haveli of sandstone?


          











What house shall I build today?


      

          











A Nicobar house standing tall on bamboo stilts?












Or a Ladakhi stone-and-brick house 
with a willow twig roof?


      











A house powered by energy from the Sun?












Or a city skyscraper made of cement blocks and mortar?


          











What house shall I build today?

Will you come 
visit me there?
