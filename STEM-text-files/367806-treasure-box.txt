I can give you ten white pebbles. I can give you three blue balloons. 
Ten and three make thirteen. 
10 + 3 = 13

		











Please, Seema. Please.


I need some of your marbles.












Do you want eight shiny beads? 

Do you want five seeds that look like red peas? 
Eight and five make thirteen. 
8 + 5 = 13













Wait. That is too much.

Ten white pebbles and three blue balloons and five red seeds make eighteen precious things.
10 + 3 + 5 = 18













You want ten white pebbles and three blue balloons and five red seeds plus eight shiny beads?

You are greedy!


Ten and three plus five is eighteen.

Another eight makes that twenty-six.
18 + 8 = 26



          











Please, Seema. Please.


      











I really need thirteen marbles.

Be a kind sister.












Okay fine.

I will give you ten white pebbles and three blue balloons, 
five red seeds and 
eight shiny beads.












Please, Seema, do be kind. 


          











I do need those thirteen marbles.
