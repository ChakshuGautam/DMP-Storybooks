Mariyu has finally decided
what she wants to
eat at the mela.
“I’m going to gobble gulabi
golas at the mela today,”
she says. “It will make my
tongue nice and pink.”
“My favourite golas are yellow like
mangoes!” Yohan tells Mariyu.

          
“I want a blue gola!”
says Akira.

      
“I want a gola that’s
both pink and blue,”
says Armaan
“In that case, I want a gola
that’s yellow and blue,” says
Muskaan, wheeling in.

          
Ammar chooses
an orange gola.

      
Dipu wants a
pink and yellow gola.
Dua likes
green golas.
Mehek wants
a purple gola.

          
Mariyu scratches her head.
How will she remember everyone’s golas?

      

          
In comes Yohan, saying,
“I know what to do!”

      
Mariyu paints a
pink circle. Yohan
paints his circle
yellow. Akira paints
a blue circle.
And Dua, Ammar and
Mehek find shades of
green, orange, and purple where
the circles overlap.
Armaan touches both pink and blue. Muskaan touches both
blue and yellow. And Dipu touches the yellow and pink.

          
“I want a gola with
all the colours,” says
Sid. “Where do I
paint it?”

      
“Right here in the
centre, where all
the circles overlap,”
replies Mariyu.
Golas and
Venn Diagrams
So many gola choices! Mariyu
was able to cleverly use a Venn
diagram to solve that problem.

          
Venn diagrams
 explain sets
and the relation between sets
using images.
A 
set 
is a collection of things,
or numbers, or shapes, or as in
this case, colours.

      
Union 
of two sets means all the parts of the two
sets. So a union of pink and blue golas (like the
one Armaan wanted), would have a pink top, a
blue bottom, and a purple middle where the blue
and pink overlap.
Intersection 
of sets means just the place where
the two sets overlap. So the intersection of pink and
blue is purple, like the gola that Mehak wanted.
