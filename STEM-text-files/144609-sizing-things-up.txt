The world is full 
of creatures 
and things. 












Some are big.

Some are small.

Most are somewhere in the middle.












These are some of the 
biggest things we know.












These are some of the 
smallest things we know.


          











Some things look big because they’re surrounded by smaller things.


      











The same things may look small when 
they’re surrounded by bigger things.


          











What looks big from close by, 
may look small from far away.

      

          











Things make bigger things. Bigger things make huge ones. Huge things make ginormous ones. Ginormous things make super-duper-mega-jumbo ones.


      

          











Things are made of small things. Small things are made of smaller ones. Smaller things are made of tiny ones, which are made of eeny-teeny-weeny things.


      











But even the eeny-teeny-weeny can make a super-duper-mega-jumbo difference in this big-small world.
