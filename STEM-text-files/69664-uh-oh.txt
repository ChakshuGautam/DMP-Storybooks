Hullo! I’m very quick!
Try to press down on my tail.
Uh-oh!
Please don’t touch any of my leaves.
I am busy looking at the clouds.
Oh no!
I’m not always this little.
See what happens when you yell 
CABBAGE!
Pffft!
I’m scared of nothing! Not even lions.
ROAAAARRRR
 
as loudly as you can.
Tshing!
An odd thing happens when I hear songs.
So do not sing 
OODLEY OODLEY OOOO
 to me.
Shoop!
Oi you, show me your scariest face.
Go on!
AAAA!
I should remain calm. But I don’t remember why.
So no sudden movements, okay?
Uh-oh!
