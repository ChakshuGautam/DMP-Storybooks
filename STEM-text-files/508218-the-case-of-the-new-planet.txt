Every evening, Anvi peers through her

telescope. On clear nights, she can spot

faraway stars and planets.

But she is most curious about aliens and

doesn’t tire of looking for them.












One night, she

sees a very bright

spot in the sky.












The spot gets

bigger and bigger.












It comes closer and closer.












And it lands in Anvi’s backyard.












It’s a spaceship!












Two red blobs peep out of the spaceship. 
Each of the blobs has three eyes, two noses 
and no hair.

Anvi rubs her eyes in disbelief! Are they aliens?











The blobs stare and stare at Anvi and then stretch out their hands.

Anvi is curious. She walks into the spaceship, as if in a dream.












The doors close as soon as she steps 
in and the spaceship takes off.












Anvi peeps out of the 
window. She can’t see 
her house anymore. 
Instead, there are huge, 
scary purple mountains 
outside.












Bump.

Thud.











Bump!












The spaceship seems

to have landed.












Anvi rushes to open the door.

She steps outside and whooooosh... 
She slips 
and falls. 
She shivers. 
The ground is covered 
with ice.












There are thousands of red blobs marching up

and down. “Where am I?” she asks the blobs.

They shrug and look up to the sky.












Anvi looks up. She sees a big red sun

and two smaller bright dots in the sky.
“It looks like there are three suns!”
she exclaims.
Again, the blobs don’t respond.











Once more, Anvi asks her new blob 
friends, “Where am I?”












This time they shake their heads.












“Could this be Jupiter? No, it is

made of gas. I wouldn’t be able

to stand on it,” she thinks.


          











“Could this be the moon of

Saturn?” she wonders. 


“
But no, 
where are Saturn’s rings?
”


      











The next day in school, Anvi runs to her best friend Rukaiyya.

“I met some aliens last night!” she says.
“They were red blobs. I went with them to their planet in a spaceship.
Which planet do you think they were from?”











“Oooo, you lucky thing! I read a book which said there are billions of planets

outside our Solar System called exoplanets. The one closest to Earth is

Proxima Centauri b. Do you think the blobs came from there?” asks Rukkaiya.
“Yes. Maybe they did. I would love to visit again,” says Anvi.











Meanwhile, on exoplanet Proxima Centauri b:

Two red blobs are sitting on a tower.












“We went into space yesterday,” one says.

“I think we reached another planet. A strange-looking

creature was staring at us. She 
followed us into 
the spaceship.”












“I heard they’ve discovered a new planet, and

named it Earth. Do you think you went there?”


          











Planet Proxima Centauri b


      











Proxima Centauri b was discovered in 2016. It revolves around the

star Proxima Centauri. Even though it is the closest planet to our

Solar System, it is still 4.2 light years or 40 trillion kilometres away

from Earth. Light from Proxima Centauri would take about four

years to reach us.












Did Anvi really go to

planet Proxima Centauri b?












Even if Anvi had travelled by the fastest

spaceship today, it would have taken

more than 70,000 years to reach

Proxima Centauri b.

So, it is unlikely that Anvi reached

Proxima Centauri b — unless the blobs

had a spaceship that goes faster than

light! (Scientists think it is impossible

to travel faster than light.)

What were the three dots that

Anvi saw in the sky?












Proxima Centauri b revolves around the star

Proxima Centauri, a small red dwarf star. This star

is redder, cooler and doesn’t shine as brightly

as the Sun. There are two other stars near it —

Alpha Centauri A and B.

If Anvi had reached Proxima Centauri b,

she would have seen Proxima Centauri

as a big red ball, and the other two

further stars as bright white dots.

Telescopes
 are magical instruments that can show us the wonders of

the universe. The James Webb Space Telescope was launched into space

by the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration

(NASA) in December 2021. 
It began capturing stunning images of light 
emitted by some of the first galaxies born in our universe. The light 
from the stars in these galaxies was emitted over 13 billion years ago 
— our universe was still very young then. Imagine, the light travelled 
about 120000000000000000000000km before reaching the James Webb 
Telescope. NASA shared the images with us Earthlings in July 2022.
