The Dordles were lost and needed lots

and lots of fuel to get home.












Their ship needed energy to lift off,

and the Dordles needed fuel to generate energy.












So they made a list of all the fuels

they could think of, and left in search of them.












Dordle B, the leader of the group,

burrowed into the ground in search of coal.












But he was surprised to find almost

all the coal used up. So he left with

a piece of coal the size of his hand.












Dordle D, the smartest of the three,

trekked to the densest forest.












But she was shocked 
to see just one tree.

Dordle D had to settle for 
a few dry branches.












Dordle E, the tiniest Dordle, sailed to

the oil fields that never dried up.












Dordle E was lucky to leave

with a few drops of oil.












The Dordles gathered their fuel, and put it into their ship

to burn and generate energy.












The engines roared, the lights came alive, the ship lifted off.

But sadly they didn’t get very far.












Disappointed, the Dordles did what Dordles do best.

They ate till their tummies reached their chest.












What Is Fuel?












A fuel is a substance that releases useful energy when it

undergoes a chemical reaction. Materials such as coal,

wood, oil and gas provide us with heat, light and energy

when they are burned. Energy can be used to cook our

food, keep us warm and make our engines run.

Fuels come in different forms. They can be solids like

wood and coal, liquids like petrol and kerosene, or

gases like Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and biogas.

We use fuel to drive cars, generate electricity for

homes and power factories.
