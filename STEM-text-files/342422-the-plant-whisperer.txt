Jaishree, a young engineering student,

looked at her noisy machines.












“Aiyyooo!

So frustrating,”

she thought.












Beep-Beep Beep

Grrrrr Grrrrr Grrrrr

Brrrrr Brrrrr Brrrrr












She missed

Paati’s garden.












The garden

had birds.

Trees.
Plants.
Grass.











Best of all,

the garden had...












Treeni, her best friend.












Treeni’s branches

were like arms,












on which she

climbed












and played












and slept.











Jaishree called her

father. “Daddy,

I am going to

study plants.”












Humphh!












Daddy was an engineer

and didn’t like it. “I can

convince him later,”

Jaishree thought.












She moved to a college to study plants.











And study she did. She finished two degrees in five

years. “But there are SO MANY questions that I do

not have answers to.”












Do plants listen to

each other?












Do plants talk

to each other?












Do they fight?












Can they be friends with each

other, like Treeni was mine?












Jaishree went many places in search of answers.











From New Delhi she went to New York and back to New Delhi.












Sadly, the answers were

nowhere to be found.












Until she went to France.

That was where she heard a story.












A lonely mustard plant could

not grow properly under stress.

It was small, sick and sad when

the temperature was too high or

too low, or when the light was

too bright or too dim, or when

the soil was too sandy.












But when the mustard plant

had a friend nearby — another

mustard plant — they both

grew tall, green and happy. The

mustard plants were helping

each other! Alone, they were

weak. Together, strong.












They helped each other,

like Treeni helped little

birds and squirrels.












They protected each other,

like Treeni protected younger

plants from harsh sunlight.












But Jaishree still had more

questions than answers!












Why do plants help each other?

How do plants help each other?












Jaishree thought and thought and

thought. She read and read and read.












She spoke to people, helpful and

unhelpful, but NOBODY had answers.












Luckily for Jaishree, mustard

plants were fun to work with.












Growing them was not difficult, and she needed only one simple tool.












A paperclip!












Jaishree used a

paperclip to sow

4,000 tiny seeds,

one at a time.












She did this whole exercise

many, many, many times.












But she didn’t get all

the answers all the

time. She failed and

failed and failed.












She failed 21 TIMES!












Jaishree had more worries. Humans are not

always as helpful as mustard plants.












She was often told wrong and unkind things.












“Women cannot

do science.”












“Indians

cannot do

science.”


          











“STOP BUGGING ME,”

Jaishree thought.

And she carried on

with her work.


      











Finally, Jaishree

succeeded.












“Oh yes, I have

found it!”












She found that

plants helped each

other all the time.












She found that some mustard plants helped only similar mustard plants.

Other mustard plants helped mustard plants that were not so similar.












As Jaishree knew, exciting answers

always lead to more questions!












“That’s curious. Why would some

plants do one thing and others do

something else? Why can’t all plants

help each other in the same way?”












She found that

plants which grew

with strangers learnt

to help those strangers.












This behaviour is shaped over

many many years by another

curious thing called evolution.












Jaishree thought, “Imagine if we

could find out which seeds to grow

together so that they help each

other. Wouldn’t that be fantastic?












“We could produce so many seeds in

so little time with much less money!”












But what seeds grow together?

How should they be grown?












Then, there are other questions too.












Are plants smart?

How smart are they?












Jaishree is on a journey 
to find these answers. 
In the meanwhile, she learns 
every day from her helpful plants.












“If only humans helped each other

more, the world would be such a

wonderful place!”












What did YOU learn from plants today?












Do you know 
H Jaishree Subrahmaniam?













Dr H Jaishree Subrahmaniam has loved plants

since her childhood in New Delhi. She quit an

engineering degree to study botany. In 2017,

Jaishree started her PhD in France.

Her research focused on altruism in plants. Using
mustard plants (Arabidopsis thaliana), Jaishree
discovered that plants help each other grow
better in times of stress. Her research also











explained that plants that have grown around

“strangers” for millions of years have learnt to

extend help to them, while other plants only help

plants that are similar to them.












In 2021, Jaishree was selected for the

prestigious Marie Curie Fellowship (named after

a very important woman scientist) to pursue

her postdoctoral research. She will attempt to

find out whether plants can be considered

intelligent or smart.












This journey, however, was not easy. Jaishree had

to face racism and sexism many times at work,

but her undeterred motivation kept her going.

She is actively involved in taking science outside

laboratories to anyone and everyone. She is also

a social worker, helping create an equitable and

welcoming space in science for women. She

believes humans have a lot to learn from plants,

especially how to extend help in times of stress

without being selfish.
