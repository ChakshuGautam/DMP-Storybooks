“Daee, can we please see

your coin collection?” 
asks Banko.












Banko is very keen to know more about coins.

He likes to spend Sundays finding old ones so

that he can also have a collection like Daee.


          











“What do you see on these coins, Banko?” asks Daee.

“INDIA!” says Banko. “And three lions.”

      
“This side with the lions is called ‘heads’,” says Daee.

“That’s a bull and a horse pulling a wheel or chakra.

Just like the chakra at the centre of our flag.
“And Daee, what are these two
animals below the lions?” asks Banko.











“Now Banko, if you flip the coin, you will see 
the 
‘tails’ side. Look it says five rupees, which is 
the 
value of the coin,” says Daee.












“What is special

about this coin, Daee?”


          
“This is a 2-rupee coin celebrating 
the ninth 
Asian Games held 
in 1982, 
the 
year 
your mother was born.”



      











“Look Daee, here’s one from 2015, 
the year 
I was born. It’s a coin that 
celebrates 
Dr B.R. Ambedkar’s 125th 
birth anniversary!” says Banko.












“Coins are so heavy, Daee!”

says Banko.












“That is why we have notes. They are

light and easy to use,” says Daee.
