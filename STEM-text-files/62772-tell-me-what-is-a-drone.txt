            
Have you ever met a drone?

        

            
Sometimes it has many wings. 
A drone is not a dragonfly
.

        
It flies from one roof to another.
A drone is not a bird.




It has a pouch to carry things in. 
A drone is not a kangaroo.
It can detect Seema’s house by the sea and Iqbal’s house in the city.
A drone is not a spy.
It delivers parcels in 30 minutes. 
A drone is not a postman.

            
Then what is a drone?
A drone is 
a clever machine.

        
It flies. It finds addresses.
It takes photographs from up above.
It carries parcels 
from 
one place 
to another.
Right now, drones are busy 
learning their jobs.
Sometimes they make mistakes. 
They crash into buildings. 
They fall from the sky.
But there are rules that stop them 
from flying everywhere.
One day, drones will criss-cross the skies.
They will rush and deliver medicines 
to villages in the hills.
They will count tigers in forests 
and help protect them.
They will photograph hidden 
corners 
of our planet.

            
One day, drones will carry biryani 
from a restaurant to Seema’s house.
Drones will carry books from 
the library to Iqbal’s house.
Drones will fly with birds 
outside your window.
Maybe someday soon, 
you will meet a drone.
