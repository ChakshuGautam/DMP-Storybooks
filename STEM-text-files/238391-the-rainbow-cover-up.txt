School was about to start again —
hooray!


Why was Bhanwari so worried?























Ma brought her ten new books for
school,


But Bhanwari forgot to cover them.
Oops! 























“Look here, didi,” said Bablu. 
He
had a way out of this bind.


He had cooked up a brilliant idea
in his mind. 























There, he pointed at the Peepal
tree. 


“What?” wondered Bhanwari, 
and
looked up to see. 























Stuck on its branches were three
rainbow kites. 


Violet, indigo, blue, green,
yellow, orange 
and red flashed in the light. 























“Well done, Bablu.


We can cover two books with one kite,


So that’s three kites to cover six
books.” 























“But Bablu, don’t forget, there
are more. 


Six of
ten are sorted. 
But what about the other four?”




















Just then they heard a call from
the street, 


“Peanuts, peanuts, a piping hot
treat!”





















“Oh, Moongfali Mamu!” called Bhanwari. 




















“I need some help. Please help me,
look! 


Do you
have some paper to cover my school books?” 


















“Here you go, little one,” 
said Moongfali Mamu, handing
them two newspaper sheets. 




















“Bablu, one newspaper sheet will
cover two books. 
Two will cover four! 


Six plus four equals ten. We don’t
need any more!”























The next day, her friends asked, 
“Where did you find these rainbow books, Bhanwari?”


Bhanwari
said, “It’s the magic of Moongfali Mamu and a rainbow tree.”
