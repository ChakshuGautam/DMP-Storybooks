Andy Prakash was only eight years old,
but he studied in Class 10.


He had more brains than the whole school.
More brains than the students, more brains
than the teachers and even more brains
than the principal! 












The walking, talking proof of his super-intelligence
was Bittu Bottu, a robot he had built all by himself.












Bittu Bottu could answer any question.
“Bittu Bottu, how tall is Mount Everest?”

“About 8,848 metres above sea level,” Bittu Bottu replied.












“Bittu Bottu, why did the chicken cross the road?”


          











Well, 
almost
 any question.


      











Bittu Bottu did Andy’s homework.












Bittu Bottu did Andy’s housework.


“
Andy!
 Clean your room yourself!”


          











Bittu Bottu did Andy’s lab work.


      

          

“Who bought all this? Diodes, resistors,
capacitors and 
transistors... And look at
the electricity bill! 
ANDY!
”


      











One day, Andy sent Bittu Bottu

to school in his place.


“Andy Prakash!”

“Present, teacher.”












The class teacher kept Bittu Bottu back at school
and sent Andy’s parents an angry text message.












“ANDY!”













“Ma, I want Bittu Bottu back.
I miss him! Please write the teacher
a letter,” Andy told Amma.
“That robot spoils you.

I won’t write it.” 


          











“Pa, please write a letter

to my teacher!”


“What, and get big electricity bills
in return? No, of course not.” 


      











Andy climbed into school that night.


          











That was when he found…


      

          











a diode


      

          











an IC


      
 
a transistor











Andy followed the trail of Bittu Bottu’s parts to the computer lab.


“Bittu Bottu is falling apart! I must have overworked him,” he thought.
“Where are you, my poor BB? 
Are you in the computer lab? I have your parts, BB!”


          











Andy found the lab locked.

CRUCK CRUCK

Someone was coming!


      











Andy hid behind a pillar as Security Anna 
walked
past the computer lab. What could he do now?
How would he give the parts to Bittu Bottu?












“Hey, Bittu Bottu,” Andy whispered.


Bittu Bottu was too weak

to walk or talk.


          











Andy threw the diode, IC and transistor
into a bag and pushed it through
the window.


      











Bittu Bottu fixed himself with the components. He crawled, little by little, to a corner.












“What are you doing, Bittu Bottu? Are you okay?” asked Andy.

“I am charging my battery, Andooo...”

“Ah, good boy! But don’t call me Andooo!”

“Okay, Andooo...”












The next morning,

Andy gave the teacher

a letter from his mother.


          











Respected Class Teacher, 


My son, Andy Prakash, studying in
your class, has promised to do all
his work without help from his robot.
Kindly do the needful and please
return the robot to him. 


Thanking you,

Yours respectfully,

Andy’s mother


P.S. This letter was not written by
another robot or by Andy, but by me. 


      











Bittu Bottu was allowed to go home with Andy that day.


          











Now Andy did the 
housework himself.


      

          











He did his lab work himself.


      











Andy even did his
homework himself...












But not always.













Bittu Bottu is made of four basic parts.


          

          











1. Power Supply 

Robots need electricity to do work. Bittu Bottu has a rechargeable battery inside and solar powered cells outside. Diodes, resistors, transistors and capacitors control the power as needed.


      

      

          











2. Actuators

Actuators are motors that use power

to help the robot move. Big motors help Bittu Bottu move from place to place. Little motors move his head and arms.


      

          











3. Sensors

Sensors allow a robot to see and hear.

Bittu Bottu’s sensors are cameras

and microphones that work as

his eyes and ears.


      

          











4. Controller 

The controller is the brain of a robot.

It understands the information from

the sensors and tells the actuators

what to do. It can be programmed to follow human commands. A controller is usually
made of integrated circuits (ICs).
