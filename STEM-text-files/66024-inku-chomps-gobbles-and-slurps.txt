            
Inku peeps out of a narrow slit in the tree trunk.
She is a Great Hornbill, born just a week ago.


SWOOSH
! SWOOSH!
 
Pa lands softly on their tree.

        
“Are these for me to play with?” asks Inku.
“No, these are figs. Eat them up,” says Pa.
 GMBH, GMBH. NUM, NUM. 
“So plump and juicy. With crunchy wasps inside!” says Inku.
“Pa has grown a tail on his bill!” says Inku. 
WHAAAA!
“Don’t cry, dear Inku,” says Ma. “It’s just a lizard.”
 CHOMP, CHOMP.
 
“Oh, it’s scaly!”
“My food has wings!” laughs Inku.
“Bats are my favourite,” says Ma.
 GOBBLE, GOBBLE. 
“So chewy! I love its squishy insides.”
“
AAAAA!
” Inku opens her bill wide, seeing a big and furry creature.
“Here comes a squirrel,” laughs Pa.
 SHOOP, SHOOP
, the squirrel slides in. 
“It tickles!”

            
“This looks a little like us,” whispers Inku.
“Yes, it’s a small bird – a bulbul,” says Pa.
 GULP, GULP. 
“Aaaalll gone!”
 
BURP!


        
“So many hands and legs!” yells Inku.
“It’s a scorpion. Beat it against the tree to make it soft,” says Ma.
DISH! DASH! BAM!
 
"Wow. Ouch. Still so sharp!”
"Are these long lizards?" asks Inku.
“No, these are snakes. Slurp them up!” says Ma, grinning.
 OOOSH, OOOSH, OOOOOOSH
, the snakes disappear one by one.
“What fun! I think snakes are my favourite.”
Inku soon grows big and strong, and leaves the nest.
HOP, HOP, HOP
, from one branch to the next.
She is so excited to explore the forest and catch her own food!
Shiny berries. Slippery frogs. Jumping grasshoppers.
What will Inku find today?
Meet the Great Hornbill
The Great Hornbill is India’s largest hornbill. Adult Great Hornbills are 3 to 4 feet tall – almost as tall as you are!
Inku’s parents found a large hollow in a big, sturdy tree. Ma entered it and shed some feathers because she would not be leaving the nest for almost three months. Ma and Pa then sealed the entrance, leaving only a small slit open. This is where Inku hatched from an egg. She lived in this nest for 10-12 weeks, until she was old enough to come out.
Pa hornbills are very busy during nesting, because Ma hornbills cannot leave the nest. Pa hornbills fly far and wide to bring a variety of tasty and nutritious food for the chick and the mother because they are very hungry all the time.
