How long do human beings live? Around 72 years. 
Does that sound like a long time? Humans share this planet with 
many amazing creatures 
that live much longer and shorter lives than we do 
— from hundreds of years to a few hours. 
In the coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean, Sea Otters live for about 
20 years, while 
Red Sea Urchins can live for 200 years.


          











In the icy Arctic waters, Greenland Sharks can live for 400 years, while the Lion’s Mane Jellyfish lives only for one.


      











Found in the floodplains of South East Asia, Asiatic Elephants can live for 70 years, while Elephant Grass lives for 
up to 15 years.













In the forests of California, Bristlecone Pine trees can live for 5000 years, while Clark’s Nutcrackers live for 15 years.












In Indian jungles, Crested Serpent Eagles can live for 40 years, while Rat Snakes live for 10 years.

Found in South East Asian countries, Oriental Honey Buzzards live for around 20 years, while Death’s Head Hawk Moths live for about three months.











Found in many parts of South Asia, Indian Pipestrelle Bats can live for over 25 years while Mosquitoes live about one month.


Found on every continent except Antarctica, House Sparrows live for about 5 years, while House Flies live for about one month. 

How different life spans can be! A pine tree can live for thousands of years, 
while a moth has only a few days under the sun. No matter 
how much time we share on planet Earth, we all play a role 
in keeping it healthy and balanced.
