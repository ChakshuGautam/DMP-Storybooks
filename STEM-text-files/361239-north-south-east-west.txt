Dear Class 4B,

Priya Miss must have told you that I won’t be coming to school 
for the next five months. I’m travelling across India with Amma 
and Appa.












They will teach me history, geography, science and maths.

But I’ll be back next year.












I miss you all and hope you miss me too.












Love,

Shaana

Hi everyone,

You won’t believe where I am!












I’m way up north, at the Thajiwas glacier in Kashmir. 
The glaciers are white and blue and we have to wear four layers 
of clothes. Appa and Amma love it here, and they like throwing 
snowballs at each other. But they say there was much more 
snow last year.












I also like the snow, but my hands are shaking from not wearing gloves, so I don’t think I can write any more.












Send my love to PT Miss and Library Sir.












Love,

Shaana

Dear Class,

We took another train yesterday and reached Himachal Pradesh. It is very quiet, and we can see so many mountains from our cabin. Colourful birds wake me with their chirping when 
the sun rises in the east.


      











I also think I hear bears growling in the west when it gets dark. 
But Amma says that’s just Appa snoring. I would love to meet 
a bear and give it a hug.












With love from your best friend,

Shaana

Hi everyone,

Did you know that Arunachal Pradesh is 
far 
away from Himachal Pradesh? Himachal is 
in the north but Arunachal is all the way in 
the east. I thought all the Pradesh states

sat next to each other.

      
We took two trains and drove a long time
to get here. This morning, we walked
through a forest to reach our treehouse.
The forest here is so thick that if you
blink or stop to tie your shoelaces,
you will get lost.











I love Arunachal the best so far and 
am           beginning to enjoy myself. I hope 
            we 
get to see red pandas.












With love,

Shaana

Dear classmates,

It did not take any time at all to

travel south west and get to the

Sundarbans in West Bengal. Today,

Amma and Appa took me out onto

the river in a small boat. Amma tells

me that places like the Sundarbans

are called wetlands. I never knew

such a place existed, and that it was

possible for trees called mangroves

to grow in seawater! But Amma

is sad about how much this place

floods today.












We also saw crocodiles and a lonely

snake while boating. I hope they

don’t follow us home.












How is everyone? Are you missing

me yet?












Love,

Shaana

Hi everyone,

We travelled across the country, all the 
way from east to west, from West Bengal 
to Gujarat, and it took us two and a half 
days!












I don’t know why my Amma and Appa

brought me to the middle of the desert.

It’s hot, dry, and there’s sand everywhere.

It’s like a beach without the sea! But I do

really love the clothes here. They’re so

pretty and colourful.












I am sure you’re all studying hard for your

half-yearly exams. Amma gave me a test

today, and I passed with 88 per cent.












Love,

Shaana

Dear class,

Today was the best day ever! We drove

east from the desert to the Narmada

river, which flows all the way to the

centre of India, and it only took us six

hours. In the afternoon, Amma, 
Appa and I went rafting in the river and 
you won’t believe how wild and scary it 
was. 
I always thought rivers were calm, 
but up close 
they’re really fast
. Appa 
says that there used to be a lot more 
water, and rafting was much scarier then.


      











I was fully wet by the time I was done,

and Appa was so scared that he swore

never to go rafting ever again. I love

the water so much and can’t wait to

go back.












Your best friend,

Shaana

Dear classmates,

Amma and Appa are fast asleep, and I should be sleeping too, but I

just love looking out the window. I think we’re in the southwest

part of the country, in Goa, and you won’t believe how nice the

plateaus look. There are so many hills here,
 
and beaches too.











There are also a lot of tunnels that the train goes through. I used 
to be afraid of tunnels, but I’m not any more. Someday, I wish we 
could all go on a tour of the plateaus. Maybe when we’re in class 11
.












Love,

Shaana

Dear friends,

I can’t believe we’re in the same state again! We travelled

south, and I will be home soon.












We reached Chennai yesterday, and on the way to 
Puducherry, we decided to learn how to surf. I think I’m good 
at it now because I only fell down twice. Amma and Appa 
splashed water on each other and behaved like children. It’s 
a good thing I was there to control them.












The beaches here are not like the ones we have on our island.

The waves are a lot rougher and the water is browner, but

I still like it here.












Your best friend,

Shaana

Hi everyone,

I just crossed the Pamban bridge.


          











I could see the ocean on both sides. How

amazing that a train can travel across the sea like this!

      

          











I’m almost home, and I can’t wait to give

you my final letter in person.


      











Love,

Shaana

Dear classmates,

I thought Amma and Appa would be tired 
from all our travelling, but we made one 
last stop at the Olaikaadu beach before

we reached home. And I’m so happy we 
did.

 
Amma wanted to teach me how to dive,

but they did not have diving suits my size,

so I spent the day floating and looking at

the fish while my parents dove below me.












We found all sorts of pebbles on the

beach, and I can’t wait to give them

to you in person tomorrow.












Your best friend,

Shaana

Dear Amma and Appa,

I can’t believe we travelled across the

whole country! I know we’re going

to miss visiting the forests, glaciers,

deserts, wetlands, plateaus and

mountains. And we are going to miss

hearing all those new languages and

meeting all those different people.

But we’re finally home now, and we

can join our friends again.












I hope we get to travel like this again,

and maybe next time we can take

our friends with us.












With love,

Shaana
