          
Come on, Anna.
Get her out!

      

          
Here comes 
Bhuvaneshwar’s
yorker.

      

          
And here
comes
Mitali’s
straight 
drive!

      

          
I’ll get 
it...

      
Snaaaaake!
Thangachi,
get me 
your bat!

          
Where 
is it?

      

          
Right next to 
our ball.

      
ANNA, 
STOP!
Before you hit us,
please listen to our story.
I’m Naagin,
a venomous
Spectacled Cobra...

          
          
and I’m Dhaman,
a non-venomous
Ratsnake...

      
      

          

          


and we’re here to
make friends
with you.


      

      

          

          
BUT from a distance.

      

      
You know, snakes are just like people.

          

          
Yeah. In so 
many ways.

      

      

          
We’re beautiful.

      

          
We’re colourful.

      

          

          
We love to dress up.

      

      

          
(Indian Rock Python)

      

          

          
(Malabar Pit Viper)

      

      

          
﻿(Ornate Flying Snake)

      

          
Just like some people
prefer to sit alone with a 
book, we like to be left 
alone too.

      

          

          
Yeah. Dhaman and I don’t really 
enjoy each other’s company. We’ve just come together 
for this book.

      

      

          
Sigh. The things
we do for you!

      

          
But there are some
differences. And that’s
what makes us snakes!

      

          
Unlike most people,
we’re unable to hear
sounds.

      

          
We can’t digest
ten idlis...

      

          
or drink milk. 
UGH!

      
But we LOVE
our food!


But our sharp tongues 
and the Jacobson’s organ 
on the roof of our mouths 
give us a keen 
sense of smell.



          
Checkered Keelbacks
love fish and frogs.

      

          

          


Shieldtails love 
earthworms.

      

      

          

          
Vinesnakes and 
King Cobras 
eat 
other snakes.

      

      

          
SLURRRRPPP
!

      

          
Most of us love rats 
and mice. We eat all 
the pests that destroy 
your crops.

      

          
Remember, snakes down here on the ground are very frightened of humans, even children, towering over them. The only time we bite is in defence.

      

          

          
Most snakes found in India are 
non-venomous 
and harmless to 
people. Like ME!

      

      

          

          
Yeah, but Dhaman 
can inflict a really stinky odour.

      

      

          

          
Hey, that’s just my
defence mechanism!

      

      

          
But there are four common venomous snake species—

      

          
including 
YOU!

      

          

          
Right. They’re responsible for 50,000 human deaths from snakebites in India every year.

      

      

          
Most bites are accidents that can be easily avoided, if you get to
know us better.

      

          

          
So let’s meet the Big Four venomous snakes! Sorry, I’m using four grass strands because I don’t have fingers.
 

      

      

          
THE BIG
FOUR

      

          
1. Spectacled Cobra

      

          
I can easily be identified by my hood 
and characteristic markings.

      

          
I am a great swimmer and love 
to hang out around water. 

      

          


My appetite for rats brings me to fields, 
houses, messy kitchens and granaries.  


      

          

          


When I’m threatened, my first response is NOT 
to bite. I do everything I can to warn
you to stay away: raise my hood, hiss, and even make false strikes with my mouth closed.


      

      

          


It’s only when none of this works or if someone steps on me, grabs me or injures me, that I am forced to bite. My venom can prove lethal.  


      

          
          
Raised hood:
stay away.

      
      

          
False strike (with 
the mouth closed): you need to back 
off right now.

      
Actual strike: you need an ambulance!

          

          
2. Saw-scaled Viper

      

      

          
Most people think I’m 
harmless because I’m tiny.

      

          
Yep.
Really tiny.

      
But my venom is very potent 
and I can strike with 
lighting speed!

          
I hang out in dry, open areas.  I am difficult to spot because of my camouflage. So if you’re playing in these fields, you need to be 
watchful for me. 

      
But don’t you 
worry; I’m not 
that difficult to identify!


You can tell I'm a 
Saw-scaled Viper by the zigzag patterns
on my back.


          

          
I too warn before I bite. I coil up like a jalebi and hiss, with my scales rubbing against each other making a saw-like sound. 
(Yes, that’s where I get my name!)

      

      
Hissss: 
this means “This isn’t 
a jalebi you would want to touch”

          
Strike: Told you so!

      

          
 
3. Common Krait

      

          

          
Namaste! I’m among the most 
docile of snakes... and yet lethal! 

      

      

          
That’s because my venom is the most potent of any 
Indian snake!

      

          

          
You can identify me by the thin 
white bands on my black hide.

      

      

          
Other non-venomous species like this Wolf Snake may resemble me, but best to keep away from us ALL.

      
Wow. You’re the worst alarm clock ever invented, Krait!

          
In my search for other snakes, rodents and lizards to eat, I crawl close to people sleeping outdoors without a mosquito net or on the floor. When they move or roll over in their sleep, I bite in self-defence.

      
4. Russell’s Viper

          
I’m the grumpiest of the big four. I like my personal space. A lot.

      
If disturbed, I can get REALLY cranky!

          
I’m often mistaken for non-venomous Boas and Pythons, and handled, and that’s a fatal mistake. Remember, if you see a  
chain-like pattern of markings on a snake’s back, it’s me.

      

          
This is an Indian Rock Python. 
Keep away.

      
This is a Common Sand Boa. Keep away.
This is me. 
Turn around and go home.

          
I sit hidden in bushes, camouflaged in leaf litter, 
waiting for my prey to come to me. 

      

          
This can be dangerous 
for people walking in the dark without a torch.

      
Avoiding this guy should be easy, right? 
You kids don’t like to hang around
grumpy old uncles anyway!
You snakes aren’t as bad as we thought! You seem like a fun bunch, if we keep our distance...

          
But how exactly do we keep a safe distance from snakes?

      

          

          
Avoiding us is easy. You just need to 
take these simple precautions.

      

      

          
1. When working in open fields or 
playing in open areas, watch where you place your hands and feet. Probing with a long stick can easily detect our presence.

      

          
2. Always use a torch at night 
when you walk outdoors, 
even near your home.

      

          
3.  If your regular path is 
littered with leaves, clear 
the litter with a rake.

      

          


4. Clean your homes,
kitchens and storehouses regularly to keep them 
rat-free.

      
5.  When sleeping outdoors or on the floor, create a physical barrier around you with the help of a well 
tucked-in mosquito net. Four rewards: no mosquito bites, no scorpion stings, no krait bites, and you get to snore away happily until morning!

          
Rarely, snakebite accidents can 
happen despite taking the best 
precautions. You need to 
remember to take these steps.

      

          
Do not take the victim 
to a tantrik or a snake
charmer for treatment

      
Do not suck the wound
Do not cut the wound open

          
Do not tie ligatures 
around the wound

      

          
Do not burn the wound

      

          
Do not apply herbal 
pastes over the wound

      

          
Immobilise the affected limb

      

          
Rush the victim to the nearest hospital that can deliver 
Anti-Snake Venom and 
emergency care

      

          
I hope it never comes to that because 
I think you creatures are quite beautiful. 
And play an important role in nature 
and our lives!

      

          
Aww,
thank you!

      
I’ll remember to help my mother clean the kitchen after every meal, so that rats don’t visit my house 
for scraps.

          
I’ll remember to tell my parents to buy a torch immediately so that they return safely from 
the fields every evening.

      

          
And I’ll remember to tell Uncle to use the mosquito net. He loves to sleep outdoors and wake the whole village up 
with his 
snoring!

      
That’s the spirit, kids!

          
While you’re at it, don’t forget to thank us for 
all the rats we eat, each time you burp after a bowl of curd rice!

      

          

          


Hahahaha!


      

      
Madras Crocodile 
Bank

          
Have you ever been to the Madras Crocodile Bank? It’s a reptile zoo in 
Chennai, which works for the conservation of reptiles. Its project 
‘Snake Conservation and Snakebite Mitigation’ teaches people about 
the importance of identifying which snakes are venomous, 
how to avoid 
them, and using antivenom serum. 
Get more information about 
snakebites and the Croc Bank at
