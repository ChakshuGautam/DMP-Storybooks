          
Nanammal and Kamalathal 
are best friends.
   Nanammal teaches yoga.
    Kamalathal runs the local idli shop.
     Nanammal likes the quiet.
      Kamalathal is always singing loudly.

      

          
          

          
Nanammal dreams of 
cool Cassata ice cream.
Kamalathal loves hot bajjis.

      

      
      

          

          
But there is one thing they
both love to do —
 travel.

      

      

          
          
Nanammal and Kamalathal are on a houseboat
in the peaceful, lush backwaters of Alleppey.
They meander along, village after village.

      
      

          
Splo
o
oooosh!

      

          

          
But she wants to spot 
the willow warbler.

      

      

          
Nanammal is a birder. So far, she has seen 
kingfishers, coucals and cormorants.

      
A fishing boat glides over.
Shiju, the fisherman, and his partner fish Nanammal
out and tell them about an island nearby.
“You might see the willow warbler there!” Shiju says.
Nanammal and Kamalathal hop onto a local ferry.
It is filled with people and goats, motorbikes and jackfruit.
The ferry is so crowded and noisy that Nanammal isn’t
able to hear the birds.
Nanammal and Kamalathal spend the entire day 
on the island, trying to spot the willow warbler.
But, they have no luck.
Uh-oh! They have missed t
he last ferry back!

          

          

          
Nanammal and Kamalathal find a row boat tucked behind a tree.
“Are you sure you know the way back?” asks Nanammal.
Asho! Kamalathal has rowed and rowed and rowed,
out of the backwaters and into...

      

      

      
.
..the sea!
Booooooooooooong!
There goes a giant cargo ship, 
carrying things from faraway 
places to the nearby port.
It stops to 
help them.
the sea!
Boo
oo
oooo
ooo
oong!
There goes a giant cargo ship,
carrying things from faraway
places to the nearby port.
It stops to 
help them.

          


“Nanammal, look!”


      

          
What are the different modes of transport that
Nanammal and Kamalathal use on water?
