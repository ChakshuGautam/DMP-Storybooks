One morning, in Class 2B...


“Psst, Anjali! Pass this note
to Ritvik,” whispers Rahul. 












Anjali passes the
note to Madhu.

          
Madhu passes it
to Anwar.

      

          
Anwar passes it
to Sanya.

      











And Sanya passes it to Ritvik. 













Ritvik reads the note – 
Nani made laddoos!

Meet me behind the canteen.













But Anjali, Madhu, Anwar and Sanya have read it too.












“Laddoos!”












“Oh no, I don’t think
 we’re getting any...”












Everyone jumps

on the laddoos.












Soon, there are

no laddoos left. 












The next day…

“Anjali, pass this to Ritvik, na?”












Anjali tries to read the note again,

but can’t understand it. 













Madhu can’t read it either.
Neither can Anwar.
Nor can Sanya. 


          











But Ritvik knows
exactly how to read it.


      











Ritvik wraps the strip of paper around his pencil,
just the way Rahul did when he wrote it.  


And the secret message is revealed! 












Making and Breaking

the Code


Rahul converts his message into

a secret code so that no one else

can read it. This method of protecting

information is called encryption. 


Ritvik wraps Rahul’s note around

his pencil to reveal the message.

This method of changing encrypted

information back into plain text

is called decryption. 


Computers also use encryption and

decryption to keep information safe.


          











Want to send secret messages

like Rahul and Ritvik?


Wrap a strip of paper around a pencil

and write your message on the wrapped

paper. Then unwrap the paper and

give it to your friend. Your friend can

read the secret message by wrapping

the paper around another pencil.
