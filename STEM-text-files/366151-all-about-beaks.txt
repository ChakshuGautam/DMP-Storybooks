More About Beaks












Woodpeckers
 have strong, sharp beaks.

With these beaks they drill holes in trees to

make nests, and also to find insects to eat.













Kingfishers
 have long, pointed beaks,

which do not disturb the water surface

when they dive in to catch fish.












Toucans
 use their colourful

beaks to show off their beauty

as well as for self-defence.












Sparrows’
 cone-shaped beaks are

stubby but sharp. They are capable of

crushing seeds in a very strong grip.












Spoonbills
 use their long, flat, rounded

beaks to search for fish, amphibians and

crabs along the bottom of muddy water.












Flamingos’
 bent beaks help them filter

out very small plankton, tiny fish and

fly larvae from shallow, muddy water.












Parrots
 use their hook-like beaks

for cracking open hard nuts.












Hornbills
 have unique helmet-like structures

on their beaks which help their call travel

farther by making the sound boom louder.












Sunbirds
 have long, curved beaks that point

downward. They use their beaks to reach nectar,

small spiders and insects deep inside flowers.












Hummingbirds
 have very long,

thin beaks with which they probe

deep into flowers for nectar.












Pelicans
 scoop up fish in their

beak pouches. The water drains

out, and the fish are swallowed.












Puffins
 can catch and carry a bunch

of fish at a time in their beaks.
