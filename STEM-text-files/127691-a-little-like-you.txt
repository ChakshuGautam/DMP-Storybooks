          
Rinki couldn’t remember who she was! 
She just couldn’t remember the word. 

      
Was she a Highnosesdust? 
Ginormosauce? 
Whymarvellous?
She decided to go for a walk and find out. 
Maybe she would meet someone who looked like her!

          
“I’m large and grey like you. Am I an elephant too?”
“Harrumph,” said Elephant. “What you say is true, but we’re taller and bigger than you. Our trunks are like pipes, our ears are all flappy. Rinki, we’re different 
from you.”

      

          
“I have a horn like some of you. 
Am I a deer too?”
“Hafloof,” said Deer. 
“What you 
say is true, 
but we’re 
shorter and 
smaller too. We have antlers, 
not horns, and they grow like 
two trees
. 
Rinki, we’re 
different 
from you.” 

      
“I love mud and water baths like you. Am I a water buffalo too?”
“Oonph,” said Water Buffalo. “What you say is true, 
but our horns are long and curvy. Our skin is a bit hairy, 
not folded or bumpy. Rinki, we’re different from you.”
“I have bumpy skin like yours. Am I a crocodile too?”
“Hurrranngh,” said Crocodile. “What you say is true, but we’re flatter than you. We have long snouts and  shiny tails. Rinki, we’re different from you.”
Rinki thought hard as she walked over to the pond.
In the water, she saw herself.

          
Big nose.
Half-moon horn.
Crumpled skin. 
Oh, now she remembered! She was a rhinoceros! 
She was a bit like the others, but she was different too. 
“Mostly,” she thought, “I am just Rinki.”

Single horn on top of 
the nose. Like a unicorn!


      

          











Lips can curl and grip 
favourite foods like 
grass, leaves, branches, fruits, and water plants. 


      

          











Three toes on each foot

Rinki is an Indian rhinoceros who lives in Kaziranga, Assam. 
Indian rhinos mostly live 
alone. 
You might see them in groups when they are mating 
or when they’re very young 
and need to stay with their mothers.

      

      

      

          
Thick skin that 
falls in folds


      
Indian rhinos are some of the biggest land animals in the country.
They're bigger than humans but smaller than elephants. 

          
Animals you can meet when you visit Kaziranga, Assam.
