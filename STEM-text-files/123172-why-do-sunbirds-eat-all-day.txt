Meet Loten. He is a long-billed sunbird.

His feathers are purple and maroon.


          











The yellow and grey bird

is his sister, Lily. 


      











Sunbirds like Loten and Lily

live in parts of India and Sri Lanka.


They are as long as a 100-rupee note

and weigh as much as a ten-rupee coin.

Loten and Lily have curved beaks

and tube-shaped tongues to gather

nectar from flowers. 












When Loten and Lily were babies,

they had short, wide beaks so that

their parents could feed them easily.












Their parents digested the food

a little in their stomachs before

feeding it to them.












When they grew strong enough,

Loten and Lily learnt to fly.


          











They also had to learn

to find their own food.


      











Loten and Lily get energy

from what they eat and drink.


          











This energy allows them

to use their muscles to fly.


      

          











Unlike us humans, Loten and Lily cannot store

much energy in their bodies as fat.












They have to stay very light.












Otherwise, they will not be able to fly.


      











This is why sunbirds have to eat

many times a day.












In fact, they spend most of their days

flying around, looking for food.












Loten and Lily drink

nectar from flowers.


          











They also like to eat

insects and spiders.


      

          











Sometimes, they eat

small, juicy fruit. 


      











If you spot a bird like Loten or Lily

in a garden or a park, take a peek

at what they are eating!


          











Where Does Energy Come From?


Energy comes from food.











Animals, including humans and birds,
need energy to 
stay alive.
It allows our bodies
to work and our brains to think.











Some birds have to eat every two hours, otherwise they 
wouldn’t
have enough energy to stay alive.
Bigger animals, like adult humans, can survive about two months
without any food, if they really have to. But to live well, we need to
eat many times a day!
