Meh-eh-eh! Meh-eh-eh!











Cheekasura ran, spraying water everywhere,

“A goat, a goat! I found a goat!”












“Daiiii... I heard the goat,”

thundered Chinnasura. “It is mine!”

“No, the goat is mine,” said Cheekasura.












By then, the whole

neighbourhood had gathered.












Ganitasuri, the number-loving asuri, said,

“There should be some way to decide who gets the goat.”












Hahasura said, “Let’s have a contest.

I will be the score-keeper.”


          

          











“Yes!” said Cheekasura. 
“Let’s have a 
neer-more drinking contest. The 
one who finishes 
drinking the spiced buttermilk

 first gets the goat.”












“Yes!” agreed Chinnasura.


      

      











Cheekasura brought giant pots filled with 
neer-more. They had markings of 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5 
and 5/5 on them. The asuras smacked their lips.

“On your mark, get set, gulp!” said Hahasura.












Cheekasura took a large gulp. C
hinnasura took a
 giant swig. 
Hahasura yelled, “Chinnasura is 
off to a good start but Cheekasura 
has opened 
with a jumbo lead.”












“The first gulp has Cheekasura drinking 
2/5ths of the neer-more while Chinnasura has 
only managed 1/5th,” said Ganitasuri.


          











“The second gulp has turned the match! 
Chinnasura 
has drunk 4/5ths of the neer-more from the pot, while Cheekasura 
has finished 3/5ths,” yelled Ganitasuri.

Hahasura said, “Chinnasura is in great form.

Can Cheekasura catch up?”
4/5 = 0.8
3/5= 0.6


      











Chinnasura’s chins were dripping.

Cheekasura’s cheeks were stinging.

“The final gulp!” squealed Hahasura.












With great effort, they

heaved their pots and drank.

Everyone held their breath.












“Aiyaiyo! Both have finished 5/5ths of the

neer-more at the same time,” 
said Ganitasuri.

Cheekasura and Chinnasura stared at each

other and let out earth-shattering burps.

Everyone clapped and waited.

5/5 = 1












“We should have a tie-breaker,” said Cheekasura.

“I am ready!” said Chinnasura.

“After a short nap,” said Cheekasura.

“I agree,” said Chinnasura.












Happy were the asuras who fell to the ground, snoring.

Happier was the goat that slipped away after grazing.

Fractions and Decimals











Fractions are parts of a whole. A fraction is

made up of two parts: It is denoted by using 
‘/’ 
symbol, such as x/y where x denotes the

numerator and y the denominator.

Example: 3/5, 8/15, 1/2












Decimals are numbers that are made up

of a whole number and the fractional part,

separated by a dot called a decimal point

For example, 16.3 is a decimal.












To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator

Example:












3/5 as a decimal is 3 ÷ 5 = 0.6

65/100 as a decimal is 65 ÷100 = 0.65

4/8 as a decimal can be simplified as 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5
