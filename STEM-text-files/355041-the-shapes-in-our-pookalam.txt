Nikku is all dressed up for Onam.
It’s pookalam day today.
Chechi and Nikku have gathered lots of flowers from the garden.
Amma is drawing a kolam —
with a circle, triangles and semi-circles.
“Let’s place leaves in the circle in the centre,” says Nikku. 
“No, we have lots of leaves. Let’s save them.
We can use the pink flowers that we don’t have much of, 
to fill the circle,” says Chechi.

			
“There are many triangles and semi-circles. 

We will need a lot of flowers to fill them,” says Chechi.
“Shall we use the red flowers for the semi-circles and 
the yellow flowers for the triangles?”asks Nikku.

		
Amma and Acchan join the fun.
Ammachi and Muthachchan bring white jasmine.

          
Now the pookalam is ready.

      
Look at the pookalam above.
Spot and count the different shapes in it.
