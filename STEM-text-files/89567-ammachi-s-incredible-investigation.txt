“Oh no, the 
unniappams
 have disappeared!” said Ammachi.
“Someone must have stolen them!” said Sooraj.
“But who?” asked Ammachi.

          
“It could have been Penny,” said Sooraj. “Or maybe it was that civet from the attic.”

      

          
“Or do you think Appachen took them?” asked Sooraj.

      
“Hmm,” said Ammachi. “Perhaps.”
“We must lay three 
BRILLIANT
 traps!”
“There’s only one way to find out,” said Ammachi.
“Oh? How?”

          
“Haha! Yum!”

      

          
“First we need more unniappams.”

      

          
“Aren’t they all gone?” asked Sooraj.

      
“No, I hid some in the kitchen,” said Ammachi. “For emergencies!”
“Our first trap is for the 
civet
,” said Ammachi. 
“When he comes through the window, he’ll fall 
right into this basket. His weight will make the lid 
fall shut automatically.”
“Amazing!” said Sooraj.
“This one is for 
Penny
. If she tries to eat the unniappam, she’ll be instantly trapped under this bucket.”
“Brilliant!” said Sooraj.
“And this hidden camera will catch 
Appachen
 red-handed,” said Ammachi. “If he lifts the unniappam off the plate, this string will slip out and trigger the camera’s shutter.”
“Genius!” said Sooraj.
“And now we wait.”
An hour passed. Ammachi was in her rocking chair, reading her favourite science book, when Sooraj came running.
“Ammachi, 
come and look! 
The traps have been sprung!”
“Oh!” said Ammachi. “Let’s see!”
“But the unniappams are all gone!” 
said Ammachi. 
“Again!”

          
“The 
basket 
trap is empty!”

      

          
“So is the 
bucket
 trap! How odd!”

      
“The 
camera
 didn’t go off either!”
“What a clever thief,” said Ammachi. “Maybe we should lay 
THREE MORE
 traps!”

          
“YES!” said Sooraj.

      
“But what will we use as 
bait
?”
“Don’t we have three more unniappams left in the oven?” asked Sooraj.
“A-HA!”
 said Ammachi. “Not so clever after all, I see!”
“Eh?” said Sooraj. “What?”
“How did you know that there were 
THREE 
unniappams left, Sooraj?” asked Ammachi. “And HOW did you know they were hidden in the 
OVEN
?”
“Ahhh…. I…. Ummm…. Ohhh….”

          
“And I didn’t tell ANYONE ELSE how the traps worked. Only 
YOU
 could have sprung them without getting caught!”

      
“Okay. OKAY!” said Sooraj. “FINE! You caught me. 
I AM
 the unniappam thief!”
“I KNEW IT!”
 said Ammachi.
“Heee. Those unniappams were TOO irresistible, Ammachi!” said Sooraj. “You’re such a 
good
 cook!”
“Hahaha! You little flatterer!” 
said Ammachi.
“Who gets to eat the remaining unniappams, Ammachi?”
“Hahaha! Come, we’ll share them!”
“Oh no!” said Ammachi. 
“The unniappams are GONE! 
AGAINNNN!”
"Hehehe!"
