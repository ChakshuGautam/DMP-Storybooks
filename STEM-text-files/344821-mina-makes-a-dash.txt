Mina hates running during PT class. Every day, when Uma Miss

makes the class run around the playground, she has a new excuse.












“My ankle hurts.”


          











“My stomach aches.”


      











“I think I saw a snake!”












Uma Miss blows her whistle.

BVEET! BVEEET! BVEEEET!

Time to head back inside.












“Don’t forget, Sports Day is 
in 
a month! All of you have t
o take 
part in the 400-metre r
ace,” 
says Uma Miss.












Mina remembers the last Sports Day. She had run super

fast and almost reached the finish line before she fell.

Everyone laughed.












That’s why she hates running

in front of other people.












“Just practise, Mina!”

says Zora.












The next day, Mina goes to school early.

She doesn’t want anyone to watch her

practise and laugh at her.












The playground looks so big and empty.

There’s so much space to run.

How far is 400 metres?












So she asks Uma Miss.












“Two loops of the playground is

400 metres,” Uma Miss explains.












“Two rounds? That doesn’t sound

too bad,” Mina says.












Mina starts near the playground gate.












She runs past the big Gulmohar tree. She’s almost

at the bench. This is harder than she thought.

She trips and catches herself. Phew!












She’s made it halfway. How far is that? One round

is 200 metres, so I’ve done 100 metres, she thinks.












The next week, Zora comes with her.

When she shouts, “READY! STEADY! GO!”

Mina runs as fast as she can.












She dashes past the big tree,

the bench, and the water cooler.

She stops at the gate and

leans against it, sweating.












“200 metres!”

says Zora.












Mina is thrilled. She only trips twice on the way to class.












Mina is determined to run two loops of

    the playground by the end of week three.

        Sports Day is only a week away!












She starts to run. Big tree. Bench. Water cooler.

Gate. Big tree. Bench... Uff, this is hard.












“350 metres!” says Aran. “You’re getting closer!”












Sports Day is tomorrow.

Aran, Zora and Anna are waiting for Mina at the playground.












“You can do this!” Anna says.












Mina runs as fast as she can. She dashes past the big

tree, the bench, the water cooler, the gate. She stumbles,

but keeps going. She’s almost at the gate, and...












“400 METRES!” shouts Aran.

“Now you just need to do this

tomorrow,” Zora says.












“Without tripping,” adds Aran.












Mina laughs. She knows she is now

ready for the race tomorrow. She only

trips once on her way to class.

She hardly notices it.












People all over the world use metres to

understand and communicate distances.












A metre is a standard unit of measurement. We use metres

to measure distance, which includes height and width.












100 centimetres make 1 metre.

1000 metres make 1 kilometre.
