Today is Priya Bua’s baby’s birthday

and the house is full of guests.












“One, two, three... fifteen, sixteen...

I give up,” says Tara.












Dada is about to make coffee, tea and sharbat.

He asks the guests what they would like to drink.












“Milk for Munna’s cereal!”

shouts Priya Bua.












“Chai for me, please,”

says Amit.












“Filter coffee, strong,”
says Indira Dadi.












“So many different requests

for coffee, tea, milk... I can’t

remember it all!” sighs Dada.












“Let me help,”

says Tara.












“What if we make a table like this?”
“I’ll ask each person what they want, and 
put a little tick under the correct column,” 
says Tara.
Tea
Coffee
Juice
Milk











“Add up all the ticks for each item to know

how many cups of each to make,” says Tara.
