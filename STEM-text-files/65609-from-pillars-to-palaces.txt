            


Dheera loves to look 
at structures.
 
Tall pillars. 
Big towers.
Wooden buildings. 
Clay buildings.
New buildings. 
Old buildings.



        

            






She wants to see them all.
She wants to know what 
they are 
made of.



        



            


So Ma and Baba make her 
a little aeroplane.
All she has to do is think 
of a structure 
she wants to see, 
whisper its name and 
TWAAAANNGGG!
And Dheera’s aeroplane takes 
her there.



        




            
            
First Dheera wants to go to... 

        
        



Iron Pillar
in Mehrauli, Delhi
Dheera sees an enormous iron pillar.
1,600 years old and almost no rust!
There are strange curls and loops on it.
She wants to hug this big and strong pillar.





            
Now Dheera wants 
to go to...

        




            

            
Golden Fort 
in Rajasthan
Dheera is in the middle of a vast desert.
A yellow sandstone fort stands on top of a hill.
There are so many homes inside the fort.
She blinks. It glitters like gold.

        

        




            
            
Now Dheera wants to go to...

        
        



Vittala Temple
in Karnataka
Dheera runs towards a large hall.
It is full of stone pillars.
There are 56 big pillars and seven small ones around each of them.
She taps the pillars. They sing
Sa Re Ga Ma Pa…





            

            


Now Dheera wants to go to...


        

        


            

            



            

            
Padmanabhapuram 
Palace in Tamil Nadu
Dheera is in a wooden palace. 
Doors, balconies, windows, 
everything is made of wood. 
Even the King’s bed is made 
of 64 pieces of wood. 
She feels like a queen here.

        

        


        

        

            


Now Dheera wants to go to...


        



            

            

            
Charminar 
in Telangana
Dheera climbs a long twisting staircase. 
She reaches the roof of a tall granite building. 
There are four towers around her. 
She wants to play in the courtyard below.

        

        

        



Now Dheera wants 
to go to...



            
Bishnupur Temples
 in West Bengal
Dheera is in a temple that looks like a cone.
So many shades of brick everywhere.
There are terracotta* lotuses on some walls.

        

            
*baked clay

        
She leans against an arch 
near the shrine.
She is tired. She whispers, 
“Let’s go home.”
