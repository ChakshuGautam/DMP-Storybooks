Nanammal and Kamalathal are best friends.












Nanammal teaches yoga.

Kamalathal runs the local idli shop.











Nanammal is very tidy.

Kamalathal is not.












Nanammal is shy.

Kamalathal loves meeting new people.












But there is one thing they both love to do — 
travel
.












Kamalathal’s birthday is this week.

Her big dream has always been to fly.

So she and Nanammal are going to Manali.












In an aeroplane!












Inside the plane, Kamalathal is so excited,

she just cannot stay still.

She wants to see where the pilot is, try on

the life jacket, and look out of the window.












The plane rumbles down the runway and

then suddenly, they’re up in the air!

“Look at the clouds,” says Nanammal,

pointing out the window.

“That one looks like an idli.”












The best friends arrive in Manali. It’s very, very cold.

Nanammal has arranged a surprise for her friend.

A hot-air balloon ride!

“Can I pull this?” asks Kamalathal.












But she’s not allowed to.












“Look at the clouds!” says Nanammal,

“That one looks like an old man’s beard!”

But Kamalathal is sad.

She wants to fly the hot-air balloon.












Nanammal hates to see her best friend sad.

So, she arranges another surprise.

This time, it’s a helicopter ride.
They fly over Manali, and their stomachs
flip-flop as they look down at the snowy
mountains, forests and rivers.











“Can I push this?” asks Kamalathal.

But she’s not allowed to.












“Look at the clouds!” says Nanammal,

“That one looks like a spinning top!”

But Kamalathal is sad.

She wants to fly the helicopter.












It’s Kamalathal’s birthday.

They have hot bajjis for breakfast.












“I have one last surprise for you,” says Nanammal.












“I’m flying, wheeeee!” shrieks Kamalathal.












“Open your eyes and look at the clouds,

Nanammal! That one looks like a cat!











“This has been the best birthday ever, Nanammal.

Thank you,” says Kamalathal.












What are the different modes of air transport

Nanammal and Kamalathal took to spot the clouds?

Where do you think Kamalathal would like to fly next?
