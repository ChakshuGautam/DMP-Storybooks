Do you know how a motorcycle works?

      

          
A motorcycle needs petrol to run.

      

          
          

          










But what exactly is going on inside the motorcycle when it runs?



      

      
      

			











A motorcycle is
basically
the same
as a cycle.

The main difference is that
a cycle is pedalled by your legs. 
But a motorcycle has
an engine that does all the work.

		
Engine

          

          











Let's take a look inside 
the motorcycle engine.


      

      

          
          

          
          











The engine is made up
of three parts: cylinder,
piston and crankshaft.


      
      

      
      
IN
Spark plug
OUT
Cylinder
Piston
Crankshaft

          

          
          

          
          
          











It also has two gates, IN and OUT, which open and close
to let petrol enter
and smoke leave the engine.


      
      
      

      
      

      

          

          
          
          
          











To get the engine started, you have to give it a kick.


      
      
      
      

      

          

          
          
The kick makes the crankshaft spin.

      
      

      

          

          
When the crankshaft spins, the piston moves 
up and down inside the cylinder.

      

      

          

          
          











When the spinning crankshaft pulls the piston down, the IN gate opens and 
lets petrol enter the cylinder.


      

      

      

          
Petrol from tank

      
IN
(closed)
IN
(open)
IN
(open)
OUT
(closed)
Then the spinning crankshaft 
pushes the piston up,

the IN gate closes and

petrol gets compressed

inside the cylinder.
IN
(closed)
OUT
(closed)

          
          











Then, a spark sets 
the petrol on fire...


      

      
Spark plug

          
...making it explode

like a firecracker.

      

          
The piston is pushed down with great force,

and it makes the crankshaft spin even faster.

      

          
IN
(closed)

      
OUT
(closed)
OUT
(closed)
OUT
(open)

          

          
          
          











Now, when the piston
moves up again, it pushes
all the smoke out through
the OUT gate.


      
      
      

      
IN
(closed)
OUT
(open)

			
			

          
The crankshaft continues to spin,  the piston moves down once again, petrol enters the cylinder and the whole cycle is repeated over and over.
1. Petrol goes in
2. Spark
3. Boom
4. Smoke goes out
The engine keeps running until it is turned off or it runs out of petrol.

		
		

          
While the engine runs...

      

          

          
          
...the crankshaft continues to spin...

      
      

      

          
          
          











...making the back wheel
of the motorcycle turn.


      
      
      

          
          
          











The back wheel drives

the motorcycle forward...


      
      

      

          

          
          

          
          











...while the front wheel is used for turning.



      
      

      
      

      

          

          
          
          











And the smoke from the engine
is let out from a pipe in the back.


      
      
      

      

			

			












Next time you sit on a motorcycle, 
you will know what is going on

inside 
this amazing machine.
