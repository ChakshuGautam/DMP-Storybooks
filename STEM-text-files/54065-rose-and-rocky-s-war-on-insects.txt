BAAAA!
 
Rocky bleated when he spotted the ants.
Rose danced all over them.
Crunch!

            
Crunch!

        
Rocky stomped his hooves when he saw the beetles.
Rose hopped on them, one by one.
Rocky ran in circles chasing the bees.
Rose waved her arms at them.
“What are you doing, Rose?” Amma asked.
“We are killing all the insects, Amma.”
“BUT WHY?”

            
BAAAAAA!

        
“Insects sting us. They bite us. They make us itch and scratch,” said Rose.
Rocky bleated in agreement.
“Do you like honey, Rose?” Amma asked.
“On my bread,” Rose said.
“Who do you think makes the honey?” Amma asked, pointing to a bee.
“Oh!” said Rose.

			
“And do you like eating vegetables from the garden, Rocky?” Amma asked.


Rocky grinned as widely as a goat can grin. 


“Who do you think keeps the vegetables safe from hungry bugs?” Amma asked.

		
“And the ants,” Amma said. 
They 
take away all 
the rubbish.”
“So without insects, we’d have no honey, no vegetables and a lot of dead cockroaches?” 
Rose asked.
“Exactly!” said Amma.
“Then what do we do, Amma?”
