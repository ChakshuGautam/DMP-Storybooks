“What’s that?”
Teju hides. 
“It won’t find me here!”
He runs. “Why are you following me?”
Leave me 
ALONE!
Go away. Go away. 
GO AWAY!
“Teju! What are you doing?” “It won’t go away!” “Your shadow?”
“It follows me everywhere! It’s like a super secret spy!”
“Well, there’s one way to make a shadow disappear...” 
Later that night in Teju’s bedroom,
the light goes off...
...and then on.
And off...

          
...and on.
Teju can’t sleep.

      
Mum gives Teju a big hug.
“Do you want to see 
something amazing?”


“What’s wrong Teju?”
“It only goes away in the dark,
but I’m scared of the dark!”


Mum and Teju make
shadow puppets until
he falls asleep.
