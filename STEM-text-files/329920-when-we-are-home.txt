			











Our home tastes like the sweet, crunchy til pitha 
that Anaideo grinds up in the kitchen.



		

			











Our home sounds like Papa’s loud snores 
shaking the bedroom as he takes his afternoon nap.


		

			











Our home looks like Ma weaving on the loom 
in the living room while Huntu and I wrestle.


		

			











Our home feels like a cool, splashy shower in the bathroom

after a hot, sweaty day of playing outside.


		











Our home smells like kopou flowers and 
ripe jackfruit as we sip tea in the courtyard.












One day, we will be home again.
