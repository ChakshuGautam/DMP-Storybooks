,

Avi is a rock. Mama calls the rock for lunch. 
Rocks cannot move on their own. So Mama picks up the rock and places it on the chair. 

      
Still,
blink,
shift.
Still—
A fly buzzes near the rock.
 
Buzz-uzz-zz,
Buzz-uzz-zz,
Buzz—
The rock sits still.
Avi is a koel today. 
The koel is building a nest.
One brown string,
two buttons,
Oo uuuo!
three sticks.
One brown string—
Woof! Woof!
Avi is a dog today. Papa gives the dog some soup in a bowl.
Slurp,
chomp.
Slurp, chomp—
Where is Avi? Avi is a chameleon today.
The chameleon moves slowly between the curtains.
Blue polka dots, white stripes, 
red-and-golden beads.
Blue polka dots—
The chameleon is trying to catch fruit flies.
One fly,
three flies. 
One fly, 
three flies—
Baa-la-la-la, 
Baa-la-la-la—
Avi is the alarm clock today. The alarm tells everyone what time it is.
Mama and Papa have to press the nose of the clock to switch it off.

Avi is a hare today. 
Hares like to jump, watch and listen.
Hop-hop-hop-bounce!
Hop-hop—
The hare is tired out by 
all the hopping around. 
Papa picks up the tired hare.

          
Snore, foof.
      
Snore—

      


      
What will Avi be tomorrow?
