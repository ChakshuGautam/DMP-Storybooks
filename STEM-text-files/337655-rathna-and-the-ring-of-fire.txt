For one full minute, the sun will disappear behind the moon.


      











There will be a thin ring of fire where a bright golden ball used to be.

Today, there is a solar eclipse.












Rathna is an astronomer at the planetarium. 












She and her friends are very excited about the solar eclipse. 
After all, it is a sight nobody should miss.












Rathna knows many secrets of the universe.












Like what happens when a billion-year-old star dies. 
And how the sun can disappear behind the moon.












Rathna shows people the best views of stars, planets and distant galaxies.


Sometimes through telescopes. 
Sometimes from her sky theatre, 

and sometimes from ancient 
observatories like the Jantar Mantar.

Today, there are two hundred eclipse glasses on Rathna’s table.
These glasses must be worn while looking at the ring of fire.
Two hundred visitors head to the telescope and projection boxes to 
take a closer look at the sky and the sun hiding behind the moon. 
Soon the sun is out and Rathna has another surprise in store.
She guides the visitors into a dark room with a domed roof.
This is the sky theatre. This is where Rathna keeps a giant projector. Everyone leans back in their seats and looks up.
The roof has turned into the night sky!











Rathna will now take them on a journey through the universe.
