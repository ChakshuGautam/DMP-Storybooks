“Good night Dia. 
Good night Tara!”
Dada turns off the light. 



          
Fliff! 
Swish!

      
What was that?
Tara looks at Dia.
Dia looks at Tara.

          
Clunk! 
Uff!

      

			
“Monster!” 
Dia and Tara 
hide under their blanket.
“What are we going to
do?” says Dia.

		


“Let’s scare it away,” Tara says.
“With a monster of our own,” says Dia. “The scarf-inator!”
“Who has a football head.”



		

          
Yaa! 
Aiyo !

      


“I think we scared it,” Tara says. 
“Oh no, it’s getting up!” Dia hides. 



          
          
Flump 
Flump!

      
      


“Quick, get your sheet,” Dia says. “We’ll make a sheet-osaur!”
“Where is the torch?” Tara asks. 
Dia points at the 
street light. 




Shump Boof! 




“And I’ll use the torch to make a chair-acabra with my raincoat,”
Dia says. 
“Two monsters should scare it away,” Tara says. “Move the torch close. We’ll make 
chair-acabra bigger!”



          

          


Clish! Creaaak!



      

      


Tara waves her hands under her sheet. 




“What are you both doing?” Dada says.
“
You
 are the monster?” 
Tara and Dia yell. 
“What monster?” 


Click! Blink!

          
Ha ha! Hoo hoo!


They all laugh and make shadow monsters.




      

          

          


 
Shadow Watching
When light shines on a solid object it creates a dark shape behind it. 
This dark shape is called a shadow. 
 
﻿﻿
Shadows change based on the light. If the light is close to the object, the shadow is bigger. If the light is far away, the shadow is smaller. The same object can cast two shadows if you shine more than one light on it! 
Different objects make different kinds of shadows. Try making shadows using objects made of different things. Shine a torch on a glass of water, a book, or a net and look at how the shadows change.
