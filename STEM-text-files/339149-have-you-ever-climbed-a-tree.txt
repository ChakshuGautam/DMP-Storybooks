I love trees. 

I love eating their fruits and smelling their flowers. And most of all, I love climbing them.

I want to climb every different kind of tree in the world.












I want to climb a jackfruit tree. 

It has a thick trunk for a good footing, and strong, sturdy branches to hold my weight. 

But I will need to watch out for falling fruit!












I want to climb a chinar tree.  

In autumn, it glows with bright, red leaves, and becomes the best hiding place. 

But, in the winter, there are no leaves left to hide in.












I want to climb a betelnut tree. 

Climbing would be easier if there were branches on the trunk. 

But I will take it as a challenge and hop, hop, hop to the top!












I want to climb a moringa tree. 

It looks easy to climb, at least to me. 

But the trunk is so thin that the higher I climb, the more it will bend downwards.












I want to climb a mangrove tree, 

with its spindly branches and giant, exposed roots. 

But to climb a mangrove tree, I will have to splash through muddy, crocodile-filled water first.












I want to climb a khejri tree. 

It would be tricky to climb the many  thin, thorny branches.

But I will twist and dodge and avoid getting pricked.












I can’t wait to climb trees all across the country.


Can you name the different trees in the pictures and mark them 
on the map?
