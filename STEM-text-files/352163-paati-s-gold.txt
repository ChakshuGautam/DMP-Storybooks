Selvan and Savi did not like it when Paati and Appa fought. 
This time, Appa was upset about his rice crop failing year after year. 
“I told you not to plant that 
lab-created rice,” said Paati.

“Everyone said it was a high-yielding 
rice variety. The production was high for the first few years. Then it 
didn’t work,” said Appa. 
“Not only did it not work, our soil lost its richness, the groundwater depleted and our crops suffered,” said Paati. 


“That Golden Rice ruined our fields. I don’t know how to recover from this loss,” said Appa.
“Don’t worry! I have real gold for you and my grandchildren,” said Paati.
Appa left in a huff.
“Paati! You know Appa is struggling to make ends meet. 
Why do you keep saying you have gold for us?” said Savi. 
“If you really had gold, we wouldn’t be 
in such misery, Paati,” said Selvan.

          

          
“One day you will see, Selva. Only then will you understand what real gold is,” said Paati, smiling.

      

      
Paati and Appa shared a bittersweet relationship. But they both cared for 
each other. 
When Appa came home from the fields, Paati would give him kaapi and appam. 

Appa would cook her idlis with par-boiled rice batter, the way she liked them. 
They even went for morning walks together. 



          
That night Paati coughed a lot. 
Appa sat next to her, giving her 
medicines. Savi and Selvan massaged her legs.
 


          

“Savi, please bring me the wooden box from the locker in my cupboard,” said Paati.


      


      


          
          


          

“Do you have the real gold hidden in the box, Amma?” teased Appa. Savi and Selvan giggled.
“You are right. This box contains real gold. 
If you spend it wisely, it will relieve you of 
your misery,” said Paati.



      


      
      


          
Paati opened the wooden box.

      

          
Inside were different rice seeds. 
They were native varieties of rice 
that Paati had saved over many years.

      
It even had lesser-known varieties like kattuyanam and garudan samba. Kattuyanam rice is drought-resistant and flood-tolerant. Garudan samba has great health benefits. 
Appa couldn’t believe his eyes.
He hugged Paati and cried. 
“This is real gold, Amma. You are right.” 
“Appa, why did Paati say this rice is gold?” asked Savi.
“One day we will see. And we will understand what she meant,” said Appa.
Several months passed. Appa’s fields flourished with Paati’s rice.
 
Many of Appa’s friends came to him looking for help and advice.
Appa helped them the same way Paati had helped him.
He gave them 2 kg of rice each with a promise that they would return 4 kg from their yield. 

He used their portions for further distribution among farmers in his village. 
Those farmers did the same. This chain continued and expanded. 


Soon, the whole village was thriving with many varieties of indigenous rice. 
Everyone had enough to eat and enough to sell. 
Appa, Selvan and Savi enjoyed evening kaapi and red rice appams with Paati. 
They looked at their golden, ripe paddy fields with pride. 
They had understood what Paati meant. This was real gold. 
Know Your Rice
The rice you eat at home comes in many different 
varieties, 
like basmati, sona masoori or kolam. Both kattuyanam and garudan samba are from Tamil Nadu. 
Kattuyanam is a red rice and is also called the 
forest elephant rice. It grows so tall that it can hide an elephant.
 It helps to hold floods and fertilises the soil. 
Garudan samba is a brown rice. It is rich in nutrients 
and fibre. It is best used for making the dish, puttu.
