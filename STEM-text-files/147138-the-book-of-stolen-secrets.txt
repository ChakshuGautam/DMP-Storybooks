Psst. How do you keep a secret safe? 
You could whisper it.
But someone might overhear you.
I hate hunting.

          
I KNEW IT!

      

          

			
			
You could send
a secret message.

		
		

      

          
But it could fall
into the wrong hands.

      
You could write it in code.
But someone might crack the code.
You could share it with
just your closest friends.

          
But someone might pretend to
be a friend to get the information.

      
As long as there have been people, there have been secrets.
And as long as there have been secrets, there have been people trying to steal them.
When computers and the Internet came along, they made
sharing information with other people a lot easier.
Unfortunately, this made stealing information easier too!
Sometimes, you might not even know
you are sharing secret information...
…for someone else to find.

You can make cyber security experts’ job easier by being careful about sharing personal information online.

          
HOW TO STAY SAFE ONLINE:
 
1.
 Don’t share information like your phone number,
birth date or home address online. 
2.
 Don’t click on links or emails that promise you 
an expensive gift or item!  
3.
 Use a password that cannot be easily guessed. 
4.
 Before you upload a photo or post on social media, think about whether you would be OK with your mum, dad or grandma seeing it. If not, don’t post it. 
5.
 Avoid talking to strangers on the Internet.
6.
 If a stranger tries to talk to you and won’t stop,
tell a grown-up you trust.
