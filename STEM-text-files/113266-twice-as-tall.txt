My name is Muthulakshmi P. and 
I am exactly 1 metre tall. That’s the same as 
100 centimetres. I know because I went 
to the doctor’s office today and the nurse 
measured me against the wall.
“You’re growing so quickly, Muthulakshmi,” 
 said the nurse.
“How tall will I be when I’m all grown up?” 
I asked.
“Nobody knows yet!” said the nurse. 
“You have to just wait and watch.”

          
I started to wonder: What if 
I doubled 
in height?
What if I grew to be 2 metres tall?
That’s the same as 200 centimetres.
I’d be taller than the nurse. I’d even
be taller than Suresh Mama, the
tallest person in my family.

      

          
﻿
1 + 1 = 2    

      
What if I doubled in height AGAIN?

          
What if I grew to be 4 metres tall?
I’d play for the Indian women’s basketball team in the Olympics.
 
I’d be the tallest person on Earth. I’d be famous! 

      
 
2 + 2 = 4    
What if I doubled in height YET AGAIN?

          
What if I grew to be 8 metres tall?
Imagine how enormous my dresses would need to be! 
I definitely wouldn’t be able to find any clothes my size  in a shop. 
I would need a very clever tailor. 

      

          
﻿
4 + 4 = 8    

      
And what if I grew twice as tall as that?
Just imagine, I would be 16 metres tall!
I could pick coconuts without climbing the trees.
﻿
8 + 8 = 16    

          
And what if I doubled that?
I’d be 32 metres tall!
I could juuuust about reach the top of the 
clock tower at Chennai Central Station.

      
﻿
16 + 16 = 32    
And if I doubled that?
I’d be 64 metres tall!
That’s taller than the Chennai Lighthouse. 
I’d stand on Marina Beach and look far out to sea.

          

          
 32 + 32 = 64

      

      
And if I doubled again?

          

          


I’d be 128 metres tall. 
That’s almost as tall as the tallest tower 
in Chennai. 
I’d help people on the top floors 
move furniture into their flats.

      

      
﻿
 64 + 64 = 128    
What if I grew twice as tall as that?
I’d be 256 metres tall!
I’d be taller than any building in Tamil Nadu.
So in thunderstorms, I’d have to be careful not 
to get struck by lightning.  
I’d make myself a 
lightning rod hat and connect 
it to the ground 
with a wire.

          
﻿
 128 + 128 = 256    

      
What if I grew twice as tall again?
512 metres!
It might get a little lonely up there.
I wouldn’t be able to see my friends
and family without binoculars.

          

          
﻿
 256 + 256 = 512    

      

      
And if I doubled in height again?
I’d be 1024 metres tall!
That’s taller than the tallest 
building in the world. 
I’d be a 
major tourist attraction. 
People 
would come from all over 
the 
world to climb on top of my head.

          
﻿
 512 + 512 = 1024    

      
And if I doubled my height again? 
[1024 + 1024 = 2048]
And again? 
[2048 + 2048 = 4096]
And again?
 [4096 + 4096 = 8192]
And again? 
[8192 + 8192 = 16384]
I’d be taller than Mount Everest.
I’d go swimming in the deepest part of the 
ocean 
and my feet would still touch the bottom.

          

          
Mariana
Trench

      

      
And what if I grew twice as tall as that? 
[16384 + 16384 = 32768]
And twice as tall as that?
 [32768 + 32768 = 65536]
And twice as tall as that? 
[65536 + 65536 = 131072‬]
My head would be in outer space! 

          
Uh oh, no air up here!
Watch out for asteroids!
Actually, maybe I don’t want to 
grow QUITE that tall.

      
I think I’m happy being 1 metre tall for now.
