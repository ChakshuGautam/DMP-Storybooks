          
When we speak into the phone,
our voice enters it in the form
of sound waves.

      

			
The sound waves rush into the microphone and are changed into electrical signals.

		
Microphone

          
The phone’s antenna changes the electrical signals into electromagnetic waves. 
These waves are picked up by the closest cell tower...

      
and then sent to a large cell tower.

          
The large cell tower passes on these waves as signals through wires, where they travel...

      

          
along mountains...
over roads...
and even undersea...

      
until finally, the signal reaches the large tower closest to the person being called.

			
			
The large tower then converts the signal into electromagnetic waves...

		
		

			
and sends it to the cell tower closest to the phone you are calling.

		

			
The phone’s antenna receives the electromagnetic waves.
And the phone changes the waves into electrical signals.

		

			
Finally, the electrical signals are converted back into sound waves using the speaker.

		
Speaker

          
And that’s how sound is heard on the other side.
