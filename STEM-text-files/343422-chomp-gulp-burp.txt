          
Our body needs food to live, move and grow. 


          

It breaks food into small pieces that can be swallowed. 
This is called ingestion.

      


      

          

It then removes waste bits and sends the 
useful parts of the food into the bloodstream.
 
This process is called digestion.




          

The animal world has bodies of all sorts, and each species ingests and digests food in its own way.

Crocodile
Butterflies
, 
bees
 and 
mosquitos
 only drink liquid food.
Spiders 
splash their prey with special juices that dissolve their bodies, making them easier to digest.
Some 
birds 
swallow small stones that help grind food down in a part of their stomachs.
Boas 
and 
pythons 
swallow their prey whole. Then their bodies secrete juices that digest the food completely.
Bees 
have two stomachs — one to digest food and one to store nectar in.

          
Meat is digested faster than plant fibre. 

That is why 
lions
 digest food faster than 
mice
.

      
Chew, Swallow, Burp! 
Cows 
have four chambers in their stomachs to help them store food. The food is then brought back up for chewing.
Goats 
and 
horses 
have three chambers in their stomachs in which food collects and ferments.
Sloths 
have three chambers in their stomachs too, and can take up to two weeks to digest a meal of leaves.
Sharks 
have very strong stomach acids and 
enzymes that speedily dissolve the food they eat.
Crocodiles 
have a unique combination of strong teeth, powerful stomach juices and stones that they ingest to grind food in their stomachs.
