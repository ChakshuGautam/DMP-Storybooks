Teena loves ghee on her Puran Poli.
“Amma, how do we get 
pure and fresh ghee?”
“From soft and white butter.”
“And how do we get butter?”
“By churning sweet and sour curd.”
“And how do we get curd?”
“From rich and creamy milk.”
“And how do we get milk?”
“Kapila, our cow, gives us milk.”
“Why does she give us milk?”
“We give her grass and lots of love.”
“Then?”
“We get milk and you get ghee
that is pure and fresh.”
A kitchen is like a science laboratory. Many physical and chemical changes take place when we cook. Milk can become a lot of yummy things. 
How do you like your milk?
