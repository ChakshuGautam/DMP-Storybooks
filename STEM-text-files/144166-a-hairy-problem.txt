“It looks like you’re eating Manasa’s hair!” 
said 
Shwetha. 

“Jangri-head!” Ravi said.

They all laughed.


      











Manasa used a ruler to check her hair: curly.

She checked Shireen’s hair: straight.

Shwetha’s hair: mostly straight.

Ravi: straight again. 

“Not fair!” Manasa said.












In the playground, Ravi bowled a ball to Manasa and said, “Eyyy, Jangri-head!”

“STOP IT!” Manasa threw her bat down and ran away. 












After school, Amma took Manasa to the sweetshop. 

“We only have jangri,” the shop lady said. “See! It looks just like your curly hair!”

“I won’t eat it!” Manasa stomped her foot. 












Titus was waiting to greet them when they got home. 
“Hi, Manasa!” 
Manasa checked Titus’s hair. 
“Straight! It’s not fair!” Manasa yelled. “Everyone has straight hair except me!” 

“Your Amma has curls,” Titus said.












“You get your curls from me,” Amma told Manasa. 

“I don’t like curls!” Manasa yelled. “They look like jangri!”

“Mmmm jangri,” Titus said. “Slurp!” 

Manasa started searching Amma’s cupboard. 












“Aha!” Manasa said. She had found Amma’s big sewing scissors. 
“I don’t want your curls, Amma,” Manasa said. “Cut them off!”

“No, Manasa!” Amma said. 

She put the scissors on a high shelf. 












“I hate my hair! It looks like jangri!” Manasa burst into tears. 
“Jangri is yummy,” Amma said. “And your curls are beautiful.”

“Why do I have curls, Amma?” Manasa wanted to know. “Titus doesn’t.”












“Titus’s parents both have straight hair, so he got it from them. I get curls from my Amma and Appa,” Amma said. “Everyone gets some things from their parents. That’s why we all look  different.”

Manasa sulked. “I didn’t ask for your curls!”












“We don’t get to choose,” Amma said. “Some parts of you look like me and some like your Appa.” 
She showed Manasa a photo. Manasa’s Appa had straight hair and a huge smile. 

Amma pointed and said, “See? You have his smile.” 
“Shiny teeth,” Titus said. 












“Is it my hair?” Manasa asked. “Or is it yours?”

“It’s your hair,” Amma replied. “But it looks like mine. And your smile looks like your Appa’s.” 

“You look okay,” Manasa decided. “I’ll keep you both!”
